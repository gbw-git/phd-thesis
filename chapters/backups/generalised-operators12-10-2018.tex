\begin{document}
We have from the Immerman-Vardi~\cite{} theorem that over linearly ordered
structures $\FP$ captures polynomial time. But $\FP$ does not capture polynomial
time over unordered structures. This motivated the introduction $\FP^{\nats}$
which allows a formula to refer either to the domain of the structure (the
element sort) or to a separate ordered copy of the domain of the structure (the
number sort). This has lead to the study of logics that relate these two domains
in some way, for example $\FPC$ extends $\FP^{\nats}$ with an operator that
defines a number term from a formula, with the number term denoting the
cardinality of the set defined by the formula.

In this chapter we introduce \emph{generalised operators}. In the same way
Lindestr\"{o}m quantifiers generalise existential and universal quantifiers,
generalised operators generalise counting and rank operators. As such,
generalised operators act on a sequence of number terms and formulas and define
a number term. Generalised operators also allow for the inclusion of a
parameter, similar to the parameter given in the definition of a rank operator
by Gradel and Pakusa~\cite{}.

We know that each formula in $\FP$ is equivalent to a formula in
$\mathcal{L}^{\omega}$ and each formula in $\FPC$ is equivalent to a formula in
$\mathcal{C}^{\omega}$. These translations from fixed-point logics to infinitary
logics have been crucial for proving almost all key separation results
(see~\cite{}). In this chapter we define what we call \emph{substitution
  programs} and show that formulas of $\FP^{\nats}$ extended by a family of
operators may be translated to appropriate $\PT$-uniform families of
substitution programs. These $\PT$-uniform families of substitution programs may
in turn be translated into formula in an extension of $\mathcal{L}^{\omega}$ by
a corresponding family of \emph{extended quantifiers}.

We also show that these $\PT$-uniform substitution programs may be translated to
$\PT$-uniform families of transparent symmetric circuits. This result gives us a
complete translation from extension of $\FP^{\nats}$ by operators to
$\PT$-uniform families of symmetric circuits. In the final section of this
chapter we discuss some special cases.

% and unordered structures motivates the introduction $\FP^{\nats}$.
% $\FP^{\nats}$ extends $\FP$ with a number-sort, allowing the logic to reason

% \begin{definition}
%   Let $L$ be a logic and $\tau$ be a vocabulary. For each $i > 0$ let $R_i$ be
%   a distinct relation symbol not in $\tau$ with arity $r_i$. We say a sequence
%   of formulas $\Phi := (\phi_1(\vec{y}_1), \ldots, \phi_k(\vec{y}_k))$ is a
%   \emph{substitution program} on $L$ if for each $i \in [k]$ we have that
%   $\phi_i$ is an $L[\tau_i]$-formula, where $\tau_i = \tau \uplus \{R_j : i <
%   j \leq k\}$, and each $\vec{y}_i$ has length $r_i$.

\section{Structures with Number-Valued Functions}
In order to define a Lindestrom quantifier we begin with a class of structures
$\mathcal{C}$ over some relational vocabulary $\rho$. An application of a
Lindestrom quantifier acts on a sequence of formulas which together define a
$\rho$-interpretation, and hence determine a $\rho$-structure. A formula with
the quantifier at its head evaluates to true if, and only if, the defined
$\rho$-structure is in $\mathcal{C}$ (for details see~\ref{}). In contrast with
Lindestrom quantifiers, generalised operators act on a sequence of number terms
(as rank operators do) and formulas (as counting operators do). As such, we
define a generalised operator from a class of (many-sorted) structures
consisting of both relations and number-valued functions. In this section we
generalise the notion of a vocabulary so as to allow for such structures and
correspondingly generalise the notion of an interpretation.

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued functions} is a tuple $\tau
  := (R, F, S, \zeta)$ where $R$ is a sequence of relation symbols, $F$ is a
  sequence of function symbols, $S$ is a sequence of sort symbols, and $\zeta$
  is a function that assigns each $H \in R \cup F$ of arity $h$ to a tuple of
  sort symbols $(s_1, \ldots, s_h)$.

  We say that $\mathcal{A}$ is a $\tau$-structure if $\mathcal{A} = (\uplus_{s
    \in S} A_s; (R^{\mathcal{A}}_i)_{R_i \in R} ; (F^{\mathcal{A}}_i)_{F_i \in
    F})$ where
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item for each $s \in S$, $A_s$ is a non-empty set,
  \item for each $R_i \in R$, $R^{\mathcal{A}}_i \subseteq A_{\zeta(R_i)(1)}
    \times \ldots \times A_{\zeta(R_i)(\ar(R_i))}$, and
  \item for each $F_i \in R$, $F^{\mathcal{A}}_i : A_{\zeta(R_i)(1)} \times
    \ldots \times A_{\zeta(R_i)(\arity(R_i))} \ra \nats$.
  \end{myitemize}

  Let $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ be $\tau$-structures. We call $h : A \ra
  B$ a \emph{homomorphism} if (i) $h$ preserves sorts, (ii) for all $R_i \in R$
  and $a \in R^{\mathcal{A}}_i$ we have $h(a) \in R^{\mathcal{B}}_i$, and (iii)
  for all $F_i \in F$ and $a \in \dom (F^{\mathcal{A}}_i)$ we have
  $F^{\mathcal{A}}_i(a) = F^{\mathcal{B}}_i(h(a))$. If $h$ is a bijection we
  call $h$ an \emph{isomorphism}.
\end{definition}


We now define a many-sorted interpretation with number-valued functions.

\begin{definition}
  Let $L$ be a logic with a number sort. Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let $\tau =
  (R, F, S, \zeta)$ be a many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued functions,
  where $R = \{R_1, \ldots, R_{r}\}$, $F = \{ F_1, \ldots, F_{f} \}$, and $S =
  \{s_1, \ldots, s_{q}\}$. For each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [f]$ let $r_i$ denote
  the arity of $R_i$ and $f_j$ be the arity of $F_j$.

  Let $k \in \nats$ and let $\ar : S \times [2] \ra \nats$. A \emph{many-sorted
    $L [\rho, \tau]$-interpretation} with \emph{width} $\ar$ and \emph{free
    variables} $\vec{w}$ (of mixed sort) is a sequence $\mathcal{I} :=
  (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i)_{i \in [r]}, (\eta_j)_{j \in
    [f]})$ of $L[\rho]$-formulas such that
  \begin{myenum}
  \item $\vec{\phi}^D = (\phi^D_1, \ldots, \phi^D_q)$, and for each $i \in [q]$,
    $\phi^D_i(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}; \vec{w})$ where $\vert \vec{x} \vert =
    \ar(s_i, 1)$ and $\vert \vec{\mu} \vert = \ar(s_i, 2)$;
  \item $\vec{\phi}^{\approx} = (\phi^{\approx}_1, \ldots, \phi^{\approx}_q)$,
    and for each $i \in [q]$ $\phi^{\approx}_i(\vec{x}_1\vec{\mu}_1, \vec{x}_2
    \vec{\mu}_2 ; \vec{w})$ where $\vert \vec{x}_1 \vert = \vert \vec{x}_2 \vert
    = \ar(s_i, 1)$ and $\vert \vec{\mu}_1 \vert = \vert \vec{\mu}_2 \vert =
    \ar(s_i, 2)$;
  \item for each $i \in [r]$, $\phi_i (\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots,
    \vec{x}^{i}_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^{i}_{r_i} ; \vec{w})$ where for each $j \in
    [r_i]$, $\vert \vec{x}^i_j\vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 1)$ and $\vert
    \vec{\mu}^i_j \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 2)$; and
  \item for each $i \in [f]$, $\nu_i (\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots,
    \vec{x}^{i}_{f_i} \vec{\mu}^{i}_{f_i} ; \vec{w})$ where for each $j \in
    [f_i]$, $\vert \vec{x}^i_j \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 1)$ and $\vert
    \vec{\mu}^i_j \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 2)$.
  \end{myenum}

  Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho]$ and let $n := \vert \mathcal{A} \vert$. Let
  $\beta$ be an assignment to $\vec{w}$ in $\mathcal{A}$. For each $i \in [q]$
  let $(\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} := \{ \vec{a}\vec{m} \in A^{\ar(s_i,
    1)} \times \nats^{\ar(s_i, 2)}: \mathcal{A} \models \phi^D_i[\beta \cup
  \alpha^{\vec{a}, \vec{m}}_{\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}}] \}$. We say that $\mathcal{I}
  (\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined if there exists $\mathcal{B} \in \fin[\tau]$
  with universe $B = \uplus_{i \in [q]} B_i$ and a sort-preserving surjection $h
  : \uplus_{i \in [q]} (\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} \ra \uplus_{i \in [q]}
  B_i$ such that
    
  \begin{myenum}
  \item for each $i \in [q]$ the relation $\approx_i$ on $B_i$ defined such that
    for each $\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1, \vec{a}_2\vec{m}_2 \in
    (\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$ we have $\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1 \approx_i
    \vec{a}_2\vec{m}_2$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models
    \phi^{\approx}_i[\beta, \alpha^{\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1,
      \vec{a}_2\vec{m}_2}_{\vec{x}_1 \vec{\mu}_1, \vec{x}_2 \vec{\mu}_2}]$ is an
    equivalence relation;
  \item let $\approx = \uplus_{i \in [q]}\approx_i$ be an equivalence relation
    on $B$, then for $a , b \in \uplus_{i \in [q]}(\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A},
      \beta)}$ if $a \approx b$ then $h(a) = h(b)$;
  \item for each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [r_i]$ let $\vec{a}^i_j\vec{m}^i_j \in
    (\phi^D_{\zeta(R_i)(j)})^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$ we have
    \begin{align*}
      h(\vec{a}^i_1 \vec{m}^i_1 , \ldots , \vec{a}^i_{r_i}\vec{m}^i_{r_i})
      \in R^{\mathcal{B}}_i \iff \mathcal{A} \models \phi_i
      [\beta, \alpha^{\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_{r_i} \vec{m}_{r_i}}_{\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1 , \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i}}];
    \end{align*}
  \item for each $i \in [f]$ and $j \in [f_i]$ let $\vec{a}^i_j\vec{m}^i_j \in
    (\phi^D_{\zeta(F_i)(j)})^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$ we have
    \begin{align*}
      F^{\mathcal{B}}_i(h(\vec{a}^i_1 \vec{m}^i_1 , \ldots , \vec{a}^i_{r_i}\vec{m}^i_{r_i})) = \eta^{(\mathcal{A}, \gamma)}_j \text{ where }\gamma := \beta \cup \alpha^{\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1, \ldots,
      \vec{a}_{r_i} \vec{m}_{r_i}}_{\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1 , \ldots,
      \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i}}.
    \end{align*}
  \end{myenum}

  In this case we write $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{I} (\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ and say
  that \emph{$\mathcal{I}$ interprets $\mathcal{B}$ in $(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$}
  or \emph{$\mathcal{I}$ interprets $\mathcal{B}$ in $\mathcal{A}$ under
    $\beta$}.

% \section{A Framework for Operators and Quantifiers}


% Lindestrom quantifiers are defined by a class of structures, with the syntax
% of the quantifier is specified so as to define an interpretation, with the
% quantifier's evaluation depending on whether In the same way Lindestrom
% quantifiers are defined from a class of structures, generalised operators are
% similarly defined from a class of structures.


% We first need to generalise the notion of a many-sorted vocabulary in order to
% include function symbols that are intended to be interpreted as number-valued
% functions.

% \begin{definition}
%   Let $L$ be a logic ($\FO$ or $\FP$) and let $\tau$ be a many-sorted
%   vocabulary with function and constant symbols and $N: \fin \ra \fin[\tau]$
%   be a function that maps isomorphic structures to isomorphic structures. Let
%   $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_q\}$ be the sorts in $\tau$. Let $\rho$ be a
%   vocabulary. Let $\tau \uplus \rho$ be the vocabulary formed by interpreting
%   $\rho$ as a many-sorted vocabulary with a single sort. We refer to the
%   single sort of $\rho$ as the \emph{element sort}. Let $L^{\tau, N}[\rho] =
%   L[\tau \uplus \rho]$ and for $\theta \in L^{\tau, N}[\rho]$ and $\mathcal{A}
%   \in \fin[\rho]$ let $\mathcal{A} \models_{L^{\tau, N}[\rho]} \theta$ if, and
%   only if, $(\mathcal{A} \uplus N(\mathcal{A})) \models_{L[\tau \uplus \rho]}
%   \theta$.
% \end{definition}

% Let $L^{\tau, N}[\rho]$ be a logic. We say $N$ is \emph{uniform} if for any
% $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \in \fin$ such that $\vert \mathcal{A} \vert = \vert
% \mathcal{B} \vert$ we have $N(\mathcal{A}) = N(\mathcal{B})$. In this case for
% each $n \in \nats$ we write $N(n)$ to abbreviate $N(\mathcal{A})$ for any
% $\mathcal{A} \in \fin$ of size $n$. We say $N$ is \emph{$\PT$-uniform} if $N$
% is uniform and $n \mapsto N(n)$ is computable in time polynomial in $n$.

% \begin{definition}
%   A \emph{many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued functions} is a tuple
%   $\tau := (R, F, S, \zeta)$ where $R$ is a sequence of relation symbols, $F$
%   is a sequence of function symbols, $S$ is a sequence of sort symbols, and
%   $\zeta$ is a function that assigns each $H \in R \cup F$ of arity $h$ to a
%   tuple of sort symbols $(s_1, \ldots, s_h)$.
% \end{definition}

% There is an obvious notion of a $\tau$-structure and isomorphism between
% $\tau$-structures.

% \begin{definition}
%   Let $L$ be a logic with a number sort. Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let $\tau
%   = (R, F, S, \zeta)$ be a many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued
%   functions, where $R = \{R_1, \ldots, R_{r}\}$, $F = \{ F_1, \ldots, F_{f}
%   \}$, and $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_{q}\}$. For each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [f]$
%   let $r_i$ denote the arity of $R_i$ and $f_j$ be the arity of $F_j$.

%   Let $\ar : S \times [2] \ra \nats$. A \emph{many-sorted $L [\rho,
%   \tau]$-interpretation} of \emph{width} $(\ar)$ is a sequence $\mathcal{I} :=
%   (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i)_{i \in [r]}, (\eta_j)_{j \in
%   [f]})$, where

%   \begin{myenum}
%   \item $\vec{\phi}^D = (\phi^D_1, \ldots, \phi^D_q)$, and for each $i \in
%     [q]$, $\phi^D_i(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu})$ where $\vert \vec{x} \vert = \ar(s_i,

%   \item for each $i \in [r]$, $\phi_i (\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots,
%     \vec{x}^{i}_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^{i}_{r_i})$ where for each $j \in [r_i]$,
%     $\vert \vec{x}^i_j\vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 1)$ and $\vert \vec{\mu}^i_j
%     \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 2)$, and
%   \item for each $i \in [f]$, $\nu_i (\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots,

%     $\vert \vec{x}^i_j \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 1)$ and $\vert \vec{\mu}^i_j
%     \vert = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(j), 2)$.
%   \end{myenum}

%   Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho]$ and for all $i \in [q]$ let
%   $(\phi^D_i)^{\mathcal{A}} := \{ \vec{a}\vec{m} \in A^{\ar(s_i, 1)} \times
%   \nats^{\ar(s_i, 2)}: \mathcal{A} \models \phi^D_i[\vec{a}\vec{m}] \}$. We
%   say that $\mathcal{I} (\mathcal{A})$ is defined if there exists $\mathcal{B}
%   \in \fin[\tau]$ with universe $B = \uplus_{i \in [q]} B_i$ and a sort
%   preserving surjection $h : \uplus_{i \in [q]} (\phi^D_i)^{\mathcal{A}} \ra

%     such that $\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1 \approx_i \vec{a}_2\vec{m}_2$ if, and only
%     if, $\mathcal{A} \models \phi^{\approx}_i[\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1,
%     \vec{a}_2\vec{m}_2]$ is an equivalence relation,
%   \item let $\approx = \uplus_{i \in [q]}\approx_i$ be an equivalence relation
%     $B$, then for $a , b \in \uplus_{i \in [q]}(\phi^D_i)^{\mathcal{A}}$ if $a
%     \approx b$ then $h(a) = h(b)$,

\section{Generalised Operators}
We are now ready to define a generalised operator and what it means to extend a
logic by a generalised operator. 

\subsection{Generalised Many-Sorted Operators}
Let $\tau = (R, F, S, \zeta)$ be a many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued
functions, where $R = \{R_1, \ldots, R_{r}\}$, $F = \{ F_1, \ldots, F_{f} \}$,
and $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_{q}\}$. For each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [f]$ let $r_i$
denote the arity of $R_i$ and $f_j$ be the arity of $F_j$.

Let $m \in \nats$ and let $E : \nats^{m} \times \fin[\tau] \ra \nats$. We say
that $E$ is \emph{closed under isomorphism} if for all $\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B}
\in \fin[\tau]$, $\vec{p} \in \nats^{m}$ if $\mathcal{A} \simeq \mathcal{B}$
then $E(\vec{p}, \mathcal{A}) = E(\vec{p}, \mathcal{B})$. Let $\ar : S \times
[2] \ra \nats$ be a function. We associate with the pair $(E, \ar)$ a
\emph{number-valued generalised operator} $\Omega_{(E, \ar)}$. We say the
\emph{vocabulary} of the operator is $\tau$, the \emph{arity} is $\ar$, the
\emph{evaluation function} is $E$, and the \emph{parameter-width} is $m$.

For a logic $L$ the extension $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$ is the closure of the set of
formulae in $L$ over the following formula formation rule:


Let $\vec{w}$ be mixed-sort sequence of variables. Let $\vec{\pi}$ be a sequence
of number terms in $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$ with free variables among $\vec{w}$. Let
$\mathcal{I} := (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i)_{i \in [r]},
(\eta_j)_{j \in [f]})$ be an interpretation with formulas and number-terms from
$L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$ with width $\ar$ and free variables among $\vec{w}$. The
following is a number-term
\begin{align*}
  \gamma (\vec{w}) = \Omega_{E, \ar} [\vec{\pi}] [\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}]  [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\chi_i))_{i \in [r]}((\vec{y}^j_1 \vec{\nu}^j_1, \ldots, \vec{y}^j_{f_j} \vec{\nu}^j_{f_j})(\eta_j))_{j \in [f]}].
\end{align*}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a structure and $\beta$ be an assignment to $\vec{w}$ in
$\mathcal{A}$. Let $\vec{p} = (\pi^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_1, \ldots,
\pi^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_m)$. If $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not
defined let $\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} := 0$ and otherwise let $\mathcal{B}
:= \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ and let $\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} := E
(\vec{p}, \mathcal{B})$.

We can similarly define a \emph{Boolean-valued generalised operator}. The
definition is analogous, but in the case the evaluation function is of the form
$E : \nats^{m} \times \fin[\tau] \ra \{0,1\}$. The extension of a logic by a
Boolean-valued operator is defined similarly, but in this case an application of
an operator is a formula rather than a number-term.

We usually denote a set of generalised operators by $\setop$. We write
$\setop_E$ to denote the set of all operators with evaluation function $E$.


% We have $\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{B} =
% \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ and $E$






% $\ar$ $mathcal{I} = $ $\vec{\phi}^D$ and $\vec{\phi}^{\approx}$ be sequences
% of formulas in $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$ and for each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [f]$
% let $\chi_i$ be a formula and $\eta_j$ a number-term in $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$.
% Let



% Let $\vec{\pi}$ be a sequence of number terms in $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})$. Let
% $\vec{\phi}^D$ and $\vec{\phi}^{\approx}$ be the $q$-sequences of formulas
% such that for each $i \in [q]$, $\phi^D_i$ has exactly $\ar(s_i, 1)$ free
% element ,ariables and $\ar(s_i, 2)$ free number variables and
% $\phi^{\approx}_i$ has exactly $2\cdot\ar(s_i, 1)$ free element variables and
% $2\cdot\ar(s_i, 2)$ free number variables. Let $(\chi_i)_{i \in [r]}$ and
% $(\eta_i)_{i \in [f]}$ be sequences of formulas and number-terms,
% respectively. For each $i \in [r]$ and $l \in [r_i]$ let $s = \zeta (R_i)(l)$
% and let $\vec{x}^i_l$ be an $\ar(s, 1)$-length tuple of element variables and
% $\vec{\mu}^i_l$ be an $\ar(s, 2)$-length tuple of number variables. For each
% $j \in [f]$ and $k \in [f_j]$ let $s = \zeta (F_i)(k)$ and let $\vec{y}^j_k$
% be an $\ar(s, 1)$-length tuple of element variables and $\vec{\nu}^j_k$ be an
% $\ar(s, 2)$-length tuple of number variables. The following is a number term:
% \begin{align*}
%   \gamma = \Omega_{E, \ar} [\vec{\pi}] [\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}]  [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\chi_i))_{i \in [r]}((\vec{y}^j_1 \vec{\nu}^j_1, \ldots, \vec{y}^j_{f_j} \vec{\nu}^j_{f_j})(\eta_j))_{j \in [f]}].
% \end{align*}
% The semantics of this operator is defined as follows: Let $\mathcal{I} :=
% (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, \vec{\chi}, \vec{\eta})$ and
% $\gamma^{\mathcal{A}} = E(\vec{\pi}^{\mathcal{A}}, \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}))$.


Let $\setop$ be a set of operators. Let $L(\widetilde{\setop})$ be the set of
all formulas and number-terms in $L(\setop)$ such that each application of a
generalised operator in $\setop$ that appears as a sub-formula or
sub-number-term has domain formulas that are valid and equality formulas that
simply test for equality. In other words, each application of an operator
defines an interpretation that involves no restriction of the domain and no
quotienting. In this case, since the domain and equality formulas have no effect
on the semantics, we omit them when applying the generalised operator.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\setop$ be a set of operators. We say a logic $L(\setop)$ is \emph{closed
    under $\setop$-quotients} if $L(\widetilde{\setop}) = L(\setop)$. If the set
  of operators $\setop$ is clear from context we say that $L(\setop)$ is
  \emph{closed under operator quotients}.
\end{definition}

It can be shown that many of the logics of interest are closed under operator
quotients.

\begin{lem}
  The logics $\FPC$ and $\FPR$ are closed under operator quotients.
  \label{lem:logics-operator-quotients}
\end{lem}

We are often interested in families of operators generated by a single
evaluation function. Let $E$ be an evaluation function. Let $\setop_E$ denote
the set of all operators $\Omega_{E, \ar}$ where $\ar$ is an arbitrary arity
function. We call $\setop_E$ the \emph{uniform operator} generated by $E$. When
we apply an operator in a formula the arity is implicitly specified by the
choice of variables. As such, when applying an operator $\Omega_{E, \ar}$ from
$\setop_E$ we often use the symbol of the uniform operator rather than the
particular operator.

We have not included any sort of bound on the functions computed by generalised
operator. We are particularly interested in logics whose formulas cannot define
numbers that are super-polynomial in the size of the structure over which they
are being evaluated. In this case each number-term denotes a value that be held
by a fixed-length tuple of number variables.

\begin{definition}
  Let $L$ be a logic with a number sort. Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let
  $\theta$ be a formula or number-term in $L[\rho]$. For each $n \in \nats$ let
  $e_{\theta}(n) $ be the maximal value of $\max\{\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \alpha)}
  : \mathcal{A} \in \fin[\mathcal{A}, n] , \,\, \alpha \in
  \asgn{\gamma}{\mathcal{A}}\}$ for any number-term $\gamma$ that appears in
  $\theta$. We call the function $e_{\theta}$ the \emph{definable-number bound}
  of $\theta$. We say $\theta$ has \emph{constant definable-number width} if
  there exists $k \in \nats$ such that for all $n \in \nats$ we have
  $e_{\theta}(n) \leq (n+1)^k - 1$. We call $k$ the \emph{definable-number
    width} of $\theta$. We say the logic $L$ has \emph{constant definable-number
    width} if for any vocabulary $\rho$ each formula in $L[\rho]$ has constant
  definable-number width.
\end{definition}

It can be shown that many commonly used logics with number-sorts have constant
definable-number width.

\begin{lem}
  The logics $\FO^{\nats}$, $\FP^{\nats}$, $\FPC$, and $\FPR$ have constant
  definable-number width.
  \label{lem:logics-constant-number-width}
\end{lem}

In many applications we only need to consider a restricted class of generalised
operators. We now introduce a few difference classes of generalised operators.

\begin{definition}
  Let $\Omega$ be a generalised operator. We say $\Omega$ \emph{operates on
    formulas} if there are no function symbols in the vocabulary of $\Omega$. We
  say that $\Omega$ \emph{has no parameters} if the parameter-width is zero. We
  say $\Omega$ \emph{operates over the structure} if it operates on formulas and
  $\Omega$ has arity $\ar$ and for each sort symbol $s$ in the vocabulary of
  $\Omega$, $\ar(s, 2) = 0$. A Boolean generalised operator that operators over
  the structure is called a \emph{normal operator}.
\end{definition}

We now show that if we extend a logic with generalised operators with constant
definable-number width then we may assume, without a loss of generality, that
the generalised operators operate on formulas.

\begin{prop}
  Let $\tau := (R, F, S, \zeta)$ be a many-sorted vocabulary with number-valued
  functions. Let $E : \nats^m \times \fin[\tau] \ra \nats$ be an evaluation
  function. Let $L$ be an extension of $\FO^{\nats}$ and suppose $L(\setop_E)$
  has constant numeric-width. There is a many-sorted vocabulary $\tau' = (R',
  S', \zeta')$ and evaluation function $E' : \nats^m \times \fin[\tau] \ra
  \nats$ such that
  \begin{myenum}
    % \item \label{obj:const-width}$L(\setop_{E'})$ has constant numeric-width,
  \item \label{obj:left-right} $L(\setop_{E}) \leq L(\setop_{E'})$, and
  \item \label{obj:FOC-right-left} if $\FOC \leq L$ then $L(\setop_{E'}) \leq
    L(\setop_{E})$.
    % \item \label{obj:FP-right-left} if $\FP^{\nats} \leq L$ then
    %   $L(\setop_{E'})
    %   \leq L(\setop_E)$.
  \end{myenum}
  It follows that if $\FOC \leq L$ then $L(\setop_{E}) \equiv L(\setop_{E'})$.
  \label{prop:op-to-op-on-formulas}
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\{R_1, \ldots, R_{r}\} := R$, $\{ F_1, \ldots, F_{f} \} := F$, and
  $\{s_1, \ldots, s_{q}\} := S$. For each $i \in [r]$ and $j \in [f]$ let $r_i$
  be the arity of $R_i$ and $f_j$ be the arity of $F_j$. Let $\tau' := (R', S',
  \zeta')$ where
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $R' = R \uplus \{R_{r + 1}, \ldots, R_{r + f}\}$,
  \item $S' = S \uplus \{s_{q+1}\}$, and
  \item for all $R_i \in R'$ if $i \leq r$ then $\zeta' (R_i) = \zeta(R_i)$,
    otherwise let $\zeta'(R_{i}) = (s_{i, 1}, \ldots, s_{i, f_{i - r}}, s_{i,
      f_{i - r} + 1})$, where $(s_{i, 1}, \ldots, s_{i, f_{i -r}}) = \zeta(F_{i
      - r})$ and $s_{i, f_{i - r}+1} = s_{q+1}$.
  \end{myitemize}
  Let $r' = r + f$ and for all $i \in [r']$ let $r_i$ be the arity of $R_i$. Let
  $T : \fin[\tau'] \ra \fin[\tau]$ be defined such that for each $\mathcal{B}'
  \in \fin[\tau']$ with universe $B' = \uplus_{i \in [q + 1]}B_i'$ we have that
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $T(\mathcal{B}')$ has universe $\uplus_{i \in [q]}B_i'$,
  \item for all $R_i \in R$, $R^{T(\mathcal{B}')}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i$, and
  \item for all $F_j \in F$, $F^{T(\mathcal{B}')}_j(b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j}) =
    \vert \{ b \in B_{q+1}': (b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j}, b) \in R^{\mathcal{B}'}_{r +
      j}\} \vert$.
  \end{myitemize}
  Let $E': \nats^m \times \fin[\tau'] \ra \nats$ be defined such that
  $E'(\vec{p}, \mathcal{B}') = E(\vec{p}, T(\mathcal{B}'))$ for all $(\vec{p},
  \mathcal{B}') \in \nats^m \times \fin[\tau']$.

  % Let $k \in \nats$. Let $T' : \fin[\tau] \ra \fin[\tau']$ be defined such
  % that
  % for each $\mathcal{B} \in \fin[\tau]$ with universe $B = \uplus_{i \in [q +
  % 1]}B_i$ we have that
  % \begin{myitemize}
  % \item $T'(\mathcal{B})$ has universe $(\uplus_{i \in [q]}B_i) \uplus
  %   B_{q+1}$,
  %   where $B_{q+1} = [(n + 1)^t - 1]$,
  % \item for all $R_i \in R'$, $R^{T'(\mathcal{B})}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}}_i$, and
  % \item for all $F_j \in F$, $F^{\mathcal{B)}}_j(b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j}) = \vert
  %   \{ b \in B_{q+1}': (b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j}, b) \in R^{T'(\mathcal{B})}_{r +
  %   j}\} \vert$.
  % \end{myitemize}

  % Let $\mathcal{B} \in \fin[\tau]$. For each $F_j \in F$ we have
  % $F^{T(T'(\mathcal{B}))}(b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j} = \vert \{ b \in B_{q+1}':
  % (b_1,
  % \ldots, b_{f_j}, b) \in R^{T'(\mathcal{B})}_{r + j}\} \vert =
  % F^{\mathcal{B}}_j(b_1, \ldots, b_{f_j})$. It follows that
  % $T(T'(\mathcal{B}))
  % = \mathcal{B}$. We also have that $R_i \in R'$, if $i \in [r]$ then
  % $R^{T(T'(\mathcal{B}))}_i = R^{T'(\mathcal{B})}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}}_i$ and
  % if
  % $i \not\in [r]$ then $R^{T(T'(\mathcal{B}))}_i = $

  % For each $R \in R'$ we have $F^{T'(t)}$

  We now prove statement~\ref{obj:left-right}. Let $\gamma$ be a number-term or
  formula of $L(\setop_{E})$. We show that there is a corresponding number-term
  or formula $\gamma' \in L(\setop_{E'})$ that translates $\gamma$ by induction
  on the structure of $\gamma$. The only interesting case is the application of
  an operator. Suppose
  \begin{align*} \gamma = \Omega_{E, \ar} [\vec{\pi}] [\vec{\phi}^D,
    \vec{\phi}^{\approx}] [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i}
    \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\phi_i))_{i \in [r]}((\vec{y}^j_1 \vec{\nu}^j_1, \ldots,
    \vec{y}^j_{f_j} \vec{\nu}^j_{f_j})(\eta_j))_{j \in [f]}],
  \end{align*}
  where $\ar : S \times [2] \ra \nats$ is the arity, $\vec{\pi} = (\pi_1,
  \ldots, \pi_m)$ is a sequence of number-terms, and $(\vec{\phi}^D,
  \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i)_{i \in [r]}, (\eta_j)_{j \in [f]})$ defines an
  $L(\setop_E)[\rho, \tau]$-interpretation. Let $\vec{w}$ be the free variables
  in $\gamma$ and let $t$ be the numeric-term width. From the inductive
  hypothesis there is a translation for each sub-formula and sub-number-term of
  $\gamma$. Let
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma' = \Omega_{E', \ar'}[\vec{\epsilon}\,][\vec{\psi}^D, \vec{\psi}^{\approx}] ((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\psi_i))_{i \in [r']},
  \end{align*}
  where
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $\ar' : S' \times [2] \ra \nats$ be defined such that $\ar'(s, i) =
    \ar(s,i)$ for all $(s, i) \in S \times [2]$, $\ar'(s_{q+1}, 1) = 0$ and
    $\ar(s_{q+1}, 2) = t$;
  \item $\vec{\epsilon} = (\epsilon_1, \ldots, \epsilon_m)$, where for each $j
    \in [m]$, $\epsilon_j$ is the translation of $\pi_j$;
  \item $\vec{\psi}^D = (\psi^D_1, \ldots, \psi^D_{q}, \psi^D_{q+1})$, where for
    each $i \in [q]$, $\psi^D_i$ is the translation of $\phi^D_i$ and
    $\psi^D_{q+1}$ is a valid formula;
  \item $\vec{\psi}^{\approx} = (\psi^{\approx}_1, \ldots, \psi^{\approx}_q,
    \psi^{\approx}_{q+1})$, where for all $i \in [q]$, $\psi^{\approx}_i$ is the
    translation of $\phi^D_i$ and $\psi^{\approx}_{q+1}(\vec{\nu}_1,
    \vec{\nu}_2) = (\vec{\nu}_1 = \vec{\nu}_2)$; and
    % \item for each $i \in [r']$, and $j \in [r_i]$, $\vec{x}^i_j$ is an
    %   $\ar'(\zeta'(R_i)(j), 1)$-sequence of element variables $\vec{\mu}^i_j$
    %   is a
    %   $\ar'(\zeta'(R_i)(j), 2)$-sequence of number variables, and
  \item for each $i \in [r']$ if $i \leq r$ then $\psi_i$ is the translation of
    $\phi_i$, otherwise let $\eta_{i - r}'$ be the translation of $\eta_{i - r}$
    and let $\psi_i = ((\sum_{l \in [\vert \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i} \vert]}
    \vec{\mu}^i_{r_{i}}(l)(n+1)^{l-1}) < \eta_{i-r}')$.
  \end{myitemize}

  Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho]$ and let $\beta$ be an assignment to $\vec{w}$
  in $\mathcal{A}$. Let $n = \vert \mathcal{A} \vert$. Let $\mathcal{I} :=
  (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i)_{i \in [r]}, (\eta_j)_{j \in
    [f]})$ be the $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})[\rho, \tau]$-interpretation defined in
  $\gamma$ and let $\mathcal{I}' := (\vec{\psi}^D, \vec{\psi}^{\approx},
  (\psi_i)_{i \in [r']})$ be the corresponding $L(\Omega_{E', \ar'})[\rho,
  \tau']$-interpretation defined in $\gamma'$. We now prove $\gamma'$ translates
  $\gamma$ using the following two claims.

  % We
  % $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined if, and only if,
  % $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined, and, second, if
  % $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined then $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A},
  % \beta) = T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))$.

  \begin{claim}
    If $\mathcal{B} = \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ then
    $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined and $\mathcal{B} =
    T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))$.
    \label{claim:not-to-dash}
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $h$ be the coordinate map that witnesses $\mathcal{B} =
    \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$. Let $B = \uplus_{i \in [q]} B_i$ be the
    universe of $\mathcal{B}$. Let $\mathcal{B}'$ be the $\tau'$-structure with
    universe $B' = (\uplus_{i \in [q]} B_i) \uplus B_{q + 1}$, where $B_{q+1} =
    [(n+1)^t - 1]_0$, and such that for each $i \in [r']$ if $i \leq r$ then
    $R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}}_i$, otherwise $R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i =
    \{(a_1, \ldots, a_{f_{i - r}}, a_{r_i}) : a_{r_i} < F^{\mathcal{B}}_{i -
      r}(a_1, \ldots, a_{f_{i - r}}) \}$. Let $h' : \uplus_{i \in [q+1]}
    (\psi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}', \beta)} \ra \mathcal{B}'$ be defined such that
    for each $\vec{b} \in \uplus_{i \in [q+1]} (\psi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}',
      \beta)}$ if $\vec{b} \in B$ then $h'(\vec{b}) = h(\vec{b})$, otherwise
    $\vec{b} \in (\psi^D_{q+1})^{(\mathcal{B}', \beta)} = [n]^t_0$ we have that
    $h'(a) = \sum_{i \in [\vert \vec{b} \vert]} b_i (n+1)^{i-1}$.

    It follows that $h'$ is sort-preserving and surjective. We now show that
    $\mathcal{B}' = \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ with coordinate map $h'$.
    Let $i \in [q+1]$ and let $\approx_i'$ be the relation defined by evaluating
    $\psi^{\approx}_i$ on $\mathcal{B}'$ with assignment $\beta$. If $i = q + 1
    $ then $\psi^\approx_i$ defines equality between the two tuples and hence
    $\approx_i'$ is an equivalence relation. Otherwise, $i \leq q$ and so
    $\approx_i = \approx_i'$. It follows that each $\approx_i'$, and hence
    $\approx' := \uplus_{i \in [q+1]} \approx_i'$, are equivalence relations.
    Let $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in \uplus_{i \in [q + 1]}(\psi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A},
      \beta)}$ if $h'(\vec{a}) = h'(\vec{b})$ then there exists $i \in [q + 1]$
    such that $\vec{a}, \vec{b} \in (\psi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{A}', \beta)}$. Suppose
    $\vec{a} \approx_i' \vec{b}$. If $i = q + 1$ then, since $\vec{a} \approx_i'
    \vec{b}$ implies $\vec{a} = \vec{b}$, we have $h'(\vec{a}) = h'(\vec{b})$.
    Otherwise, $i \leq q$ and so, since $\vec{a} \approx_i' \vec{b}$ implies
    $\vec{a} \approx_i \vec{b}$, we have $h'(\vec{a}) = h(\vec{a}) = h(\vec{b})
    = h'(\vec{b})$.

    It remains to show that $\approx_i'$ is a congruence. Let $i \in [r']$. If
    $i \leq r$ then this follows trivially. Suppose $i > r$. For each $j \in
    [r_i]$ let $k \in [q + 1]$ such that $s_{k} = \zeta(R_i)(j)$ and let
    $\vec{a}^i_j\vec{m}^i_j \in (\phi^D_{k})^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$. It follows
    that $r_i = f_{i - r} + 1$ and $\ar'(\zeta'(R_i)(r_i), 1) = 0$ and so
    \begin{align*}\setlength{\jot}{3ex}

    It follows that $\mathcal{B}' = \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$. It
    remains to show that $\mathcal{B} = T(\mathcal{B}')$, but this follows from
    the following three observations
    \begin{myitemize}
    \item $\uplus_{i \in [q]} B_i$ is the universe of both $\mathcal{B}$ and
      $T(\mathcal{B}')$;
    \item for each $R_i \in R$, $R^{\mathcal{B}}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i =
      R^{T(\mathcal{B}')}_i$; and
    \item for each $F_i \in F$, $(b_1, \ldots, b_{i}) \in \dom
      (F^{\mathcal{B}}_{i - r})$, and $b \in B_{q+1}$ we have
      $F^{\mathcal{B}}_i(b_1, \ldots, b_{f_i}) > b$ if, and only if, $(b_1,

  \begin{proof}
    Let $\mathcal{B}' := \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ with coordinate map
    $h'$ and universe $B' = \uplus_{i \in [q + 1]} B_i$. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be
    the $\tau$-structure with universe $B = \uplus_{i \in [q]}B_i$ and such that
    for each $R_i \in R$ we have $R^{\mathcal{B}}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i$ and
    for each $F_i \in F$ we have $F^{\mathcal{B}} (b_1, \ldots, b_{f_i}) = \vert
    \{b \in B_{r_{r + i}} : (b_1, \ldots, b_{f_i}, b) \in R^{\mathcal{B}'}_{r +
      i}\} \vert$. Let $h$ be the restriction of $h'$ to $\uplus_{i \in [q]}
    (\psi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}', \beta)}$. It remains to show that $\mathcal{B} =
    \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ with coordinate map $h$. This follows from
    a very similar argument as in Claim~\ref{claim:not-to-dash}.
  \end{proof}


  % From Claims~\ref{} and~\ref{} it follows that $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},
  % \beta)$ is defined if, and only if, $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is
  % defined, and if $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined then
  % $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta) = T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))$.

  Suppose $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not defined. Then, from
  Claim~\ref{claim:dash-to-not}, $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not
  defined and so $\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} = 0 = (\gamma')^{(\mathcal{A},
    \beta)}$. Otherwise, $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined and so,
  from Claim~\ref{claim:not-to-dash}, $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is
  defined and $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta) = T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},
  \beta))$. Then $(\gamma')^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} =
  E'(\vec{\epsilon}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}, \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)) =
  E(\vec{\pi}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}, T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))) =
  E(\vec{\pi}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)},\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)) =
  \gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} $, where $\vec{\pi}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} =
  (\pi^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_1, \ldots, \pi^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_m)$ and
  $\vec{\epsilon}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} = (\epsilon^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_1,
  \ldots, \epsilon^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}_m)$, and from the inductive
  hypothesises, $\vec{\pi}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} =
  \vec{\epsilon}^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$. This concludes the proof of
  statement~\ref{obj:left-right}.
  
  % that if is defined if, and only if, $\mathcal{I}' (\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is

  % is not hard to verify that $T(\mathcal{B}) = \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},

  % with coordinate map $h$. Suppose $\mathcal{I}' (\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is

  % $h$


  % It follows that if $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not defined then
  % $\gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} = (\gamma')^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$. Suppose
  % $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined. Then
  
  % It can be shown that $\gamma'$ translates $\gamma$. Statement (1) follows.

  We next prove statement~\ref{obj:FOC-right-left}. The proof is by a similar
  induction. Let $\gamma'$ be a number-term or formula of $L(\setop_{E'})$. We
  show that there is corresponding number-term or formula $\gamma \in
  L(\setop_{E})$ that translates $\gamma$. Again, the only interesting case is
  the application of an operator. Suppose
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma' = \Omega_{E', \ar'}[\vec{\epsilon}\,][\vec{\psi}^D, \vec{\psi}^{\approx}] ((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\psi_i))_{i \in [r']},
  \end{align*}
  for some $\ar' : S' \times [2] \ra \nats$. Let
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma := \Omega_{E, \ar} [\vec{\pi}] [\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}]  [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\phi_i))_{i \in [r]}&((\vec{x}^{r + j}_1 \vec{\mu}^{r + j}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^{r + j}_{f_j} \vec{\mu}^{r+j}_{f_j})(\eta_j))_{j \in [f]}],
  \end{align*}
  where
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $\ar : S \times [2] \ra \nats$ and $\ar = \restr{\ar'}{S \times [2]}$;
  \item $\vec{\pi} = (\pi_1, \ldots, \pi_m)$ and for each $j \in [m]$, $\pi_j$
    is the translation $\epsilon_j$;
  \item $\vec{\phi}^D = (\phi^D_1, \ldots, \phi^D_{q})$, where for all $i \in
    [q]$, $\phi^D_i$ is the translation of $\psi^D_i$;
  \item $\vec{\phi}^{\approx} = (\phi^{\approx}_1, \ldots, \phi^{\approx}_q)$,
    where for all $i \in [q+1]$, $\phi^{\approx}_i$ is the translation of
    $\psi^\approx_i$;
  \item for all $i \in [r']$, $\phi_i$ is the translation of $\psi_i$; and
  \item for all $i \in [f]$ and $j \in [f_j]$, $\eta_i := \#_{\vec{x}^{r +
        i}_{f_i + 1}\vec{\mu}^{r + i}_{f_i + 1}}[\phi^D_{q+1},
    \phi^\approx_{q+1}] \cdot \phi_{r+i}$.
  \end{myitemize}
  
  It remains to show that $\gamma$ translates $\gamma'$. Let $\mathcal{A} \in
  \fin[\rho]$ and let $\beta$ be an assignment to $\vec{w}$ in $\mathcal{A}$.
  Let $\mathcal{I} = (\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}, (\phi_i))_{i \in [r]},
  (\eta_j))_{j \in [f]})$ be the $L(\Omega_{E, \ar})[\rho, \tau]$-interpretation
  defined in $\gamma$ and let $\mathcal{I}'$ be the corresponding $L(\Omega_{E,
    \ar})[\rho, \tau']$-interpretation defined in $\gamma'$. Following the same
  approach as for statement~\ref{obj:left-right}, we need to show (i) if
  $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined then $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},
  \beta)$ is defined and $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta) =
  T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))$ and (ii) if $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},
  \beta)$ is defined then $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined.

  Suppose $\mathcal{B} := \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ with coordinate map
  $h$. We aim to show that $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined and
  $T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)) = \mathcal{B}$. Let $B = \uplus_{i \in
    [q]}B_i$ be the universe of $\mathcal{B}$. Let $B_{q + 1} = [(n + 1)^{t} -
  1]_0$. Let $\mathcal{B}'$ be the $\tau'$-structure with universe $B' =
  \uplus_{i \in [q+1]} B_i$ and such that for all $i \in [r']$ if $i \leq r$
  then $R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i = R^{\mathcal{B}}_i$ and otherwise
  $R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i = \{(b_1, \ldots, b_{r_i} ) : F^{\mathcal{B}} (b_1,
  \ldots, b_{r_i - 1}) > b_{r_i}\}$. Let $h' : \uplus_{i \in [q +
    1]}(\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}', \beta)} \ra \uplus_{i \in [q+1]} B_i$ be
  defined for $\vec{a} \in \uplus_{i \in [q + 1]}(\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}',
    \beta)}$ such that if $\vec{a} \in \uplus_{i \in
    [q]}(\phi^D_i)^{(\mathcal{B}', \beta)}$ then $h'(\vec{a}) = h(\vec{a})$ and
  otherwise $h'(\vec{a}) = \sum_{l \in [\vert \vec{a} \vert]} a_l (n + 1)^{l -
    1}$. It remains to show that $\mathcal{B}' = \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A},
  \beta)$ with coordinate map $h'$ and that $T(\mathcal{B}') = \mathcal{B}$.
  Both of these statements follow from a very similar argument as in
  Claim~\ref{claim:not-to-dash}.

  Suppose $\mathcal{B}' = \mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ with coordinate map
  $h'$. We aim to show that $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined. Let
  $B' = \uplus_{i \in [q+1]} B_i$ be the universe of $\mathcal{B}'$. Let
  $\mathcal{B}$ be the $\tau$-structure with universe $B := \uplus_{i \in [q]}
  B_i$ and such that for all $R_i \in R$, $R^{\mathcal{B}}_i =
  R^{\mathcal{B}'}_i$ and for all $F_i \in F$, $F^{\mathcal{B}}_i (b_1, \ldots,
  b_{f_i})= \vert \{b \in B_{q + 1} : (b_1, \ldots, b_{f_i}, b) \in
  R^{\mathcal{B}'}_{i + r}\}\vert$. Let $h = \restr{h'}{B}$. It is easy to see
  that $T(\mathcal{B}) = \mathcal{B}'$. Again, it can be shown, following a
  similar argument as in Claim~\ref{claim:not-to-dash}, that $\mathcal{B} =
  \mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$.

  It follows then that if $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not defined then
  $\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is not defined, and if
  $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \beta)$ is defined then $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A},
  \beta) = T(\mathcal{I}'(\mathcal{A}, \beta))$. It follows that
  $(\gamma')^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)} = \gamma^{(\mathcal{A}, \beta)}$. This
  concludes the proof of statement~\ref{obj:FOC-right-left}, and the
  proposition.

\begin{lem}
  Let $L$ be an extension of $\FOC$ and let $\setop$ be a set of generalised
  operators that act on formulas. Suppose $L(\setop)$ has constant
  definable-number width. There is a family of Boolean-valued generalised
  operators that act on formulas $\setop'$ such that $L(\setop) \equiv
  L(\setop')$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  From Lemma~\ref{lem:op-to-op-on-formulas} we may assume, without a loss of
  generality, that the operators in $\setop_E$ acts on formulas. Let $E' :
  \nats^{m + 1} \times \fin[\tau] \ra \{0,1\}$ be defined such that $E'(\vec{a},
  b, \mathcal{A}) = 1$ if, and only if, $E(\vec{a}, \mathcal{A}) = b$ for all
  $\vec{a} \in \nats^m$, $b \in \nats$, $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\tau]$.

  We first show that $L(\setop_E) \leq L(\setop_{E'})$. Let $\theta(\vec{x}) \in
  L(\setop_E)$. We prove this result by induction on the structure of
  $\theta(\vec{x})$. Let $\gamma$ be a sub-formula or sub-number-term in
  $\theta(\vec{x})$. The interesting case is where $\gamma$ is an application of
  an operator in $\setop_E$. Suppose then
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma = \Omega_{E, \ar}[\vec{\pi}][\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}] ((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\phi_i))_{i \in [r]}.
  \end{align*}
  is a number term, and let $\psi(\vec{x})$ be a formula that contains $\gamma$
  and such that $\psi$ does not strictly contains a formula that contains
  $\gamma$. It follows that $\psi$ is of the form $\gamma X \delta$, where
  $\delta$ is a number term and $X$ is either `$=$' or `$\leq$'. Let
  $\vec{\epsilon}$ be a $t$-length vector of variables not in $\theta$ and
  assume we have already defined a number-term $\delta' \in L(\setop_{E'})$,
  that translates $\delta$. Let $\psi' = \exists \vec{\epsilon} \, \gamma' \land
  \, \vec{\epsilon} X \delta'$, where $\gamma'$ is a formula defined such that
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma' = \Omega_{E', \ar}[\vec{\pi}', (\epsilon_1 + \epsilon_2 \cdot (M+1) + \ldots + \epsilon_t \cdot (M+1)^{t-1})][\vec{\psi}^D, \vec{\psi}^{\approx}] ((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\psi_i))_{i \in [r]}
  \end{align*}
  where
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $\vec{\pi}$ is a translation of $\vec{\pi}'$,
  \item $M = \#_x (x = x)$ and for each $i \in [t - 1]$ $(M+1)^{i}$ is the $i$th
    power of $M+1$,
  \item $\vec{\psi} = (\psi^D_1, \ldots, \psi^D_{q})$, where for all $i \in
    [q]$, $\psi^D_i$ is the translation of $\phi^D_i$,
  \item $\vec{\psi}^{\approx} = (\psi^{\approx}_1, \ldots, \psi^{\approx}_q)$,
    where for all $i \in [q]$, $\psi^{\approx}_i$ is the translation of
    $\phi^D_i$, and
  \item for all $i \in [r]$, $\psi_i$ is the translation of $\phi_i$.
  \end{myitemize}
  It can be shown that $\psi'$ translates $\psi$. It remains to show that
  $L(\setop_{E'}) \leq L(\setop_{E})$. The idea is to simply replace any
  application of a (Boolean-valued) operator in $\setop_{E'}$ with formula that
  tests for the equality. We omit the details here.
\end{proof}

It follows from Lemmas~\ref{} and~\ref{} that we may assume, without a loss of
generality, that so long as we are interested in logics that are extensions of
$\FOC$, any given set of generalised operators $\setop$ is normal.

% We have defined the extension of a logic by an operator so as to allow for the
% inclusion of man the operator we may also specify formulas (e.g.\
% $\vec{\phi}^D, \vec{\phi}^{\approx}$) that may be used to restrict the domain
% and introduce a quotienting operator.


% The definition of extending a logic by a family of operators the possibility
% of defining a many-sort interpretation as part of the application of the
% operator. In many cases extension of a logic by a family of Lindstr\"{o}m
% quantifiers does not allow for the taking of interpretations. We can similarly
% define for a logic $L$ and set of operators $\setop$ an extension
% $L^{~}(\setop)$ that is defined similarly, but that does not allow for any
% definition of a

% \begin{definition}
%   We say a logic $L(\setop)$ is \emph{closed under operator quotients} if
%   $L^{~}(\setop) = L(\setop)$.
% \end{definition}

% We state the following easy to prove lemma.

% \begin{lem}
%   The logics $\FP^{\nats}$, $\FPC$, and $\FPR$ are closed under operator
%   quotients.

% For each $i \in [q]$ let $B_i = \phi^D_i / \phi^{\approx}_i$. Let $i \in
% [l_1]$. For each $j \in [r_i]$ let $e_j \in B_{\zeta(R_i)(j)}$. We define
% $R^B_i$ by $(e_1, \ldots, e_{r_i}) \in R^{B}_i$ if, and only if, there exists

% \vec{m}_j \in e_j$ for all $j \in [r_i]$ and $\mathcal{A} \models \theta_i
% [\vec{a}_1\vec{m}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_{r_i} \vec{m}_{r_i}]$. We define
% $F^{B}_j$ such that $F^B_j (e_1, \ldots, e_{f_j}) = k$ there exists
% $(\vec{a}_1, \vec{m}_1, \ldots , \vec{a}_{r_i} \vec{m}_{r_i})$ such that

% (k = \nu_i [\vec{a}_1, \vec{m}_1, \ldots , \vec{a}_{r_i} \vec{m}_{r_i}])$. Let
% $\mathcal{B}$ be the structure defined from the above. We have $\mathcal{A}
% \models (k = ...)$ if, and only if, $E(\vec{\pi}^{\mathcal{A}},
% \vec{\phi}^{\mathcal{A}}, \mathcal{B}) = k$.


% \begin{definition}
%   Let $\Omega_{E, \ar}$ be a many-sorted operator. We say $\Omega_{E, \ar}$
%   \emph{operates on formulas} if there are no function symbols in the
%   vocabulary of $\Omega_{E, \ar}$. We say that $\Omega_{E, \ar}$ \emph{has no
%   parameters} if the parameter-width is zero. We say $\Omega_{E, \ar}$ is
%   \emph{numberless} if it operates on formulas and for all $s \in S$, $\ar(s,
%   2) = 0$. We call a numberless Boolean operator a \emph{many-sorted
%   quantifier}.

% \begin{lem}
%   Let $L$ be a logic and $\setop$ be a set of operators. There is a set of

% \end{lem}

% \subsection{Boolean-Valued Operators}
% We can add a number term parameter and the operator evaluates to a value equal
% to this number term.

% \subsection{Operators on Formulas}
% We can replace each number term with a formula with an extra type. Summation
% over this extra type gets you back to the previous formula.

% We may thus assume, without a loss of generality, that the operators only
% operate on formulas and are Boolean valued.

\section{Extended Quantifiers}
A standard approach for studying the expressive power of fixed-point logics,
including $\FPC$ and $\FPR$, involves associating with each of these logics a
more expressive bounded-variable (single-sorted) infinitary logic. These
infinitary logics often admit pebble-game based characterisations (see~\cite{}
or~\cite{}) and are much simplier to analysis. As such, this correspondence
between fixed-point and infintary logics has proved a very useful for proving
inexpressibility results.In this section we present a general construction that
associates with each set of operators $\setop$ a set of \emph{extended
  quantifiers} $\setquant$ such that $\FP^{\nats}(\setop) \leq
\mathcal{L}^{\omega}(\setquant)$.

We could think of an extended quantifier as being similar to a lindestrom
quantifier but with two important differences. First, extended quantifiers are
defined by classes of many-sorted structures and interpretations, rather than
relational stuctures and interpretations. Second, extended quantifiers have a
more complex syntax that allows them to `simulate' number variables. We will now
formally define extended quantifiers.




% Extended quantifiers are defined by a class of many-sorted structures. An
% application of a quantifier in a formula defines an interpretation, with the
% formula evaluating to true for a given structure if, and only if, the
% interpretation is a member of the class of structures.


% Extended quantifiers generalise Lindestrom quantifiers. Extended quantifiers
% generalise Lindestrom quantifiers in two respects.


% Extended quantifiers defined by a class of many-sorted

% are similar to Lindestrom quantifiers in being define by a class of

% define the interpretation


% in that they are defined by a class of structures

% quantifiers are defined over classes of structures, extended quantifiers are
% defined over classes of many-sorted structures. The semantics of an extended
% quantifier is also defined in order to allow for the simulation of number
% terms. We now define this notion of an extended quantifier formally.


% We may think of extended quantifiers as being an extension of Lindestrom
% quantifiers that extends Lindestrom quantifiers

% in this chapter thus far. We now provide a general approach for assosiating a
% given fixed-point logics with some generalised operators and

% In this section we present a generic construction, and show how to associate
% with each extension of fixed-point logic with a set of generalised operators
% with a bounded-variable infinitary logic.

% In this section we show that each set of operators $\setop$ defines a
% corresponding set of quantifiers $\setquant$ such that $\FP^{\nats} (\setop)
% \leq \mathcal{L}^{\omega}()$






% We then prove lower-bounds for the corresponding infinitary logic, and these
% lower bounds then hold for the corresponding fixed-point logic as well.


% $\FO^{\nats}(\Omega)$ is to define some set quantifiers $Q$



% Many of the logics of interest in finite model theory are extensions of
% fixed-point logics with some set


% It was shown by blah~\cite{} and blah~\cite{} that $\FP^{\nats} \leq
% \mathcal{L}^\omega$ and $\FPC \leq \mathcal{C}^{\omega}$. There is a similar
% result for the rank logic of Dawar et al.~\cite{} by Holm~\cite{}.


% These results allow us to prove inexpressibly results for fixed-point logics
% by instead proving inexpressibly results for a corresponding extension of a
% bounded-variable infinitary logic, have proved very useful in finite model
% theory (see~\cite{}).

% These results, allow us to study extensions of fixed-point logics by some
% operator

% $\FPC$ has been to associate with the counting operator a set of counting
% quantifiers $(C^{>k})_{k \in \nats}$, and then to show that each formula in

% formula in $\FPC$ is and then show that each


% Many of the logics of interest in finite model theory, including $\FPC$ and
% $\FPR$, can be defined as extension of $\FP^{\nats}$ by generalised operators.
% A standard approach for studying the expressive power of these logics involves
% associating with the operators a class of quantifiers, and then showing that
% each formula in the fixed-point logic is equivalent to a formula of
% bounded-variable infinitary logic without number sorts (e.g.\ $\FPC \leq
% \mathcal{L}^\omega ((\mathcal{C}^{\geq k})_{k \in \nats})$).

% We aim to develop a general way of associating with each logic extended by a
% set of generalised operators with an appropriate infinitary logic. Before we
% do so, we need to show how to associate a set of operators with an appropriate
% set of quantifiers that make no reference to a number sort. In this subsection
% we introduce \emph{extended quantifiers}. A

Let $\tau = (R, S, \zeta)$ be a many-sorted vocabulary where $R = \{R_1, \ldots,
R_{r}\}$, and $S = \{s_1, \ldots, s_{q}\}$. For each $i \in [r]$ let $r_i$
denote the arity of $R_i$. Let $m \in \nats$, $E : \nats^{m} \times \fin[\tau]
\ra \{0,1\}$ be isomorphism-closed, and let $\ar : S \times [2] \ra \nats$. We
associate with the pair $(E, \ar)$ and tuple $(n,\vec{p}, k) \in \nats \times
\nats^{m} \times \nats$ an \emph{extended quantifier} $Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E,
  \ar}$. For a logic $L$ the extension $L(Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar})$ is
defined by extending the formula-formation rule for $L$ as follows:
\begin{textbox}[13.8cm]
  For each $i \in [r]$, $l \in [r_i]$ let $s^i_l = \zeta (R_i)(l)$ and let
  $c^i_l = \ar(s^i_l, 2)$. Let $T^i := [n]^{c^i_l}_0 \times , \ldots, \times
  [n]^{c^i_{r_i}}_0$ and let $T$ be the function that maps $i \in [r]$ to $T^i$.
  Let $\Upsilon_i : T^i \ra L(Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar})$ and for each $l \in
  [r_i]$ let $\vec{x}^i_l$ be an $\ar(s^i_l, 1)$-length tuple of element
  variables. For each $z \in [q]$ let $\vec{x}_z$, $\vec{y}^1_z$, and
  $\vec{y}^2_z$ be $\ar(s_z, 1)$-sequences of variables. Let $\vec{w}$ be a
  sequence of variables and let $\vec{\phi}^D := (\phi^D_1(\vec{x}_1; \vec{w}),
  \ldots, \phi^D_q(\vec{x}_q; \vec{w}))$ and $\vec{\phi}^\approx :=
  (\phi^\approx_1(\vec{y}^1_1, \vec{y}^2_1; \vec{w}), \ldots,
  \phi^{\approx}_q(\vec{y}^1_q, \vec{y}^2_q; \vec{w}))$ be $L(Q^{n, \vec{p},
    k}_{E, \ar})$-formulas. Then
  \begin{align*}
    \phi := Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar} [\vec{\phi}^D,
    \vec{\psi}^D][(\vec{x}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i}) \cdot \Upsilon_i]_{i \in
    [r]},
  \end{align*}
  is a formula in $L(Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar})$. Let
  \begin{align*}
    \free{\phi} := &\bigcup_{i \in [q]} [(\free{\phi^D_i} \setminus
                     \vec{x}_i) \cup (\free{\phi^\approx_i} \setminus
                     (\vec{y}^1_i \cup \vec{y}^2_i))] \cup \\ &\bigcup_{i \in [r], a \in
                                                                \dom(\Upsilon_i)}(\free{\Upsilon_i(a)} \setminus (\bigcup_{j \in

  \end{align*}
  We call $T$ the \emph{numeric domain} of $Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar}$.
\end{textbox}
The semantics of the formula $\phi$ is defined for a structure $\mathcal{A} \in
\fin[\rho]$ and assignment $\alpha$ to the free variables in $\phi$ as follows:
\begin{textbox}[13.8cm]
  For each $i \in [r]$ let
  \begin{align*} \chi_i (\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i}

      T_i}[(\bigwedge_{j \in [r_i]} \vec{\mu}^i_j= \vec{a}_j) \land
    \Upsilon_i(\vec{a}_1, \ldots, \vec{a}_{r_i})(\vec{x}^i_1, \ldots,
    \vec{x}^i_{r_i})].
  \end{align*}
  be a formula in the extension of $L^{\nats}(Q^{n, \vec{p}, k}_{E, \ar})$ and
  for each $j \in [q]$ let $\vec{\mu}_j$, $\vec{\nu}^1_j$, and $\vec{\nu}^2_j$
  be $\ar(s_j, 2)$-sequences of number variables and let $\psi^D_j(\vec{x}_j
  \vec{\mu}_j) := (\vec{\mu}_j = \vec{\mu}_j) \land \phi^D_j (\vec{x}_j)$ and
  $\psi^\approx_j(\vec{y}^1_j \vec{\nu}^1_j, \vec{y}^2_j \vec{\nu}^2_j; \vec{w})
  := (\vec{\nu}^1_j = \vec{\nu}^2_j)\land \phi^\approx_j (\vec{y}^1_j ,
  \vec{y}^2_j ; \vec{w})$. Let $\mathcal{I} = (\vec{\psi}^D, \vec{\psi}^\approx,
  (\chi_i)_{i \in [r]})$ be an interpretation. Then $\mathcal{A} \models \phi
  [\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}, \alpha)$ is defined and
  $E(\vec{p}, (\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{A}), \alpha)) = k$.

The important difference between extended quantifiers and Lindestrom

We think of extended quantifiers as being similar to Lindestrom quantifiers but
with two important differences. First, the most important

but with


We may associate a set of operators with a set of extended quantifiers. Let
$\setop$ be a set of generalised operators. Let $\setquant$ be the set of
extended quantifiers such that $Q \in \setquant$ if, and only if, there exists
$\Omega_{E, \ar} \in \setop$ with parameter-width $m$, $\vec{p} \in \nats^m$,
and $n \in \nats$ such that $Q = Q^{E, \ar}_{\vec{p}, n}$. We say that
$\setquant$ is the set of extended quantifiers corresponding to $\setop$.

\section{Translating Formulas to Substitution Programs}
We now introduce the notion of a substitution program. A substitution program is
a finite sequence of formulas such that each formula may contain second-order
variables that correspond to formulas that come later in the sequence. The idea
is that a substitution program is a `compact' way of writing a formula, one that
allows formulas to repeatedly apply a formula without having to rewrite it each
time. We use substitution programs as a step towards our translation to
circuits. We also show that each substitution program can be translated to an
equivalent formula of an infinitary logic.

\begin{definition}
  Let $L$ be a logic and $\rho$ be a vocabulary. A $L[\rho]$-\emph{substitution
    program} is a sequence of formulas $\Phi := (\phi_1(\vec{y}_1, \vec{\mu}_1;
  \boldsymbol{V}_1), \ldots, \phi_k(\vec{y}_k, \vec{\mu}_i;\boldsymbol{V}_k))$,
  such that there is a sequence $V_1, \ldots, V_k$ of second-order variables and
  for each $i \in [k]$:
  \begin{myitemize}
  \item $\phi_i$ is a formula in $L[\rho]$,
  \item $\vec{y}_i$ and $\vec{\mu}_i$ are sequences of element and number
    variables, respectively,
  \item $V_i$ has the same type as $(\vec{y}_i, \vec{\mu}_i)$, and
  \item $\boldsymbol{V}_i \subseteq \{V_j : i < j \leq k\}$.
  \end{myitemize}
  For each $i \in [k]$ the \emph{flattening} of $\Phi$ at $i$ is defined
  recursively as follows. If $i = k$ then the flattening of $\Phi$ at $i$ is
  $\phi_i$. If $i < k$ the flattening of $\Phi$ at $i$ is defined by replacing
  each second-order variable $V_j$ appearing in $\phi_i$ with the flattening of
  $\Phi$ at $j$. The \emph{flattening} of $\Phi$ is the flattening of $\Phi$ at
  $1$.

  Let $\alpha$ be an assignment to the variables $\vec{y}_1$ and $\vec{\mu}_1$.
  Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\tau]$. We write $\mathcal{A} \models \Phi[\alpha]$
  to abbreviate $\mathcal{A} \models \phi[\alpha]$, where $\phi$ is the
  flattening of $\Phi$. The \emph{formula-length} of a substitution program
  $\Phi$ is the maximal length (i.e.\ number of symbols) of the formulas in
  $\Phi$. The \emph{variable-width} of a substitution program is the maximum
  variable-width of a formula appearing in the program.
\end{definition}

We often work with substitution programs where the sequence is indexed by a
finite linearly ordered set, rather than an initial segment of the natural
numbers.

The proof of the following result follows from the standard `unrolling' of the
fixed-point operators. For more detail please see~\cite{}.

\begin{lem}
  Let $\setop$ be a set of generalised operators. Let $\setquant$ be the
  associated family of extended quantifiers. If a query can be defined in
  $\FP^{\nats} (\setop)$ then it can be defined by a $\PT$-uniform family of
  $\FO^{\nats} (\setop)$-substitution programs with a constant bound on the
  variable-width and formula-length.
  \label{lem:unroll-fixed-point}
\end{lem}

% \begin{lem}
%   Let $\setop$ be a set of unrestricted operators. For each $n \in \nats$ let
%   $\setquant$ be the corresponding set of number domain non-uniform
%   number-domain non-quotienting quantifiers generated by $\setop$. Let
%   $\theta(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}) \in \FO^{\nats} (\setop)$ be a formula defined
%   in terms of the mixed-sort relation variables $V_1, \ldots, V_k$. Let $m =
%   \vert \vec{\mu} \vert$ and for each $i \in [k]$ let $v_i$ be the arity of
%   the element sort and let $m_i$ be the arity of the number sort in $V_i$. Let
%   $n \in \nats$. For each $i \in [k]$ and $\vec{b} \in [n]^{m_i}$ we define an
%   element-sort relation variable $V_{\i, vec{b}}$ of arity $v_i$. There exists
%   a sequence of $\FO(\setquant)$ formulas $\{\theta_{\vec{a}}(\vec{x}) :
%   \vec{a} \in [n]^{m}\}$ where each $\theta_{\vec{a}}(\vec{x})$ is defined in
%   terms of the relation variables $\bigcup_{i \in [k]} \{V_{i, \vec{b}} :
%   \vec{b} \in [n]^{m_i}\}$.
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   We say that a number term $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ in
%   $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)$ has a \emph{translation for $n$} if there is a
%   sequence of $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas $(\phi^{\eta}_{n, k;
%   \beta}(\vec{y}))_{\beta \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}}}$ such that for each
%   $\tau$-structure $\mathcal{A}$ of size $n$ and for each assignment $\alpha
%   \in [n]^{\vec{y}}$ we have that $\mathcal{A} \models \phi^{\eta}_{n, k;
%   \beta}[\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{a} \models (\eta = k)[\alpha \cup
%   \beta]$.

%   We say a formula $\psi(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ in $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)$ has a
%   \emph{translation for $n$} if there is a sequence of
%   $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas $(\phi_{n; \beta} (\vec{y}))_{\beta \in
%   [n]^{\vec{\mu}}}$ such that each $\tau$-structure $\mathcal{A}$ of size $n$
%   and each assignment $\alpha \in [n]^{\vec{y}}$, we have that $\mathcal{A}
%   \models \phi_{n; \vec{\beta}}[\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models
%   \phi[\alpha \cup \beta]$.

%   We aim to show that $\theta(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu})$ has a \emph{translation for
%   $n$} by induction on the structure of the formula. It is easy to see that if
%   $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ is a number variable or a constant (i.e. $0$ or
%   $1$) then $\eta$ has a translation for $n$. In the case that $\psi(\vec{y})$
%   is a formula is a formula containing no number terms then there is an
%   obvious translation for $n$. If $psi(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = V_i(\vec{y},
%   \vec{\nu})$ then the assignment $\psi_{n; \beta}(\vec{y}) = V_{i,
%   \beta(\vec{\nu})}$ defines a translation.

%   Let $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ be a number term and suppose all sub-formulas
%   and sub-number-terms of $\eta$ have a translation for $n$. Let $\beta \in
%   [n]^{\vec{\nu}}$. Suppose $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = \eta_1(\vec{y}_1,
%   \vec{\nu}_1) \cdot \eta_2(\vec{y}_2, \vec{\nu}_2)$. Let $\beta_1 \in
%   [n]^{\vec{nu}_1}$ and $\beta_2 \in [n]^{\vec{nu}_2}$ be assignments
%   compatible with $\beta$. Let $\psi^{\eta}_{n, k ; \beta} (\vec{y}) =
%   \underset{a, b \leq k, a \cdot b = k}{\bigvee}(\psi^{\eta)_1}_{n, a;
%   \beta}(\vec{x}) \land \psi^{\eta_2}_{n, b; \beta}(\vec{x}))$. The other
%   arithmetic cases are handled similarly.

%   We now consider the application of an operator. Let $\Omega \in \setop$ and
%   suppose

%   \begin{align*}
%   \eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = \Omega_{E} [\vec{\pi}] [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\chi_i))_{i \in [l]}].
% \end{align*}
% For each $i \in [l]$ let $T_i = [n]^{c_1} \times , \ldots, \times
% [n]^{c_{r_i}}$. Let $T$ be a function that maps $i \in [l]$ to $T_i$. where
% $c_{j}$ is the arity of ...
% \begin{align*}
%   \psi^{\eta}_{n, k; \beta}(\vec{x}) := \bigvee_{p_1, \ldots, p_{\vert \vec{\pi} \vert}, e \leq M}[&(\bigwedge_{i \leq \vert \vec{\pi}\vert} \psi^{\pi_{i}}_{n, p_i; \beta}(\vec{x})) \\ &\land Q_{E, T ; (p_1, \ldots, p_n); e} ((\vec{x}^{j, \vec{t}}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^{j, \vec{t}}_{r_i}) \cdot (\chi_{i, \vec{t}})_{ n; \beta})_{j \in [l], \vec{t} \in T_j}]
% \end{align*}
% \end{proof}

% \begin{lem}
%   Let $\setop$ be a set of non-quotienting operators. Let $\setquant :=
%   \setquant_{\setop}$ be the corresponding set of extended quantifiers. If a
%   query can be defined by a $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO^{\nats} (\setop)$
%   substitution programs formulas then it can be defined by a $\PT$-uniform
%   family of $\FO (\setquant)$ substitution programs
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let $(f_n : [M_n] \ra \FO^{\nats} \ra

% The proof of the following result follows from the standard `unrolling' of the

%   and relation-width.
% \end{lem}

Let $L$ be a logic with constant definable-number width. Let $\rho$ be a
vocabulary. We say that a $\PT$-uniform family of $L[\rho]$-substitution
programs $(\Phi_n)_{n \in \nats}$ is \emph{bounded} if there is a constant $k
\in \nats$ such that for each $n \in \nats$ the numeric-width and length of each
formula in $\Phi_n$ is less than $k$. We aim to show that every bounded
$\PT$-uniform family of $\exlogic{\FO^{\nats}}{\setop}$-substitution programs
can be translated to equivalent $\PT$-uniform families of
$\FO(\setquant)$-substitution programs. We define a translation for a bounded
$\PT$-uniform family of $\exlogic{\FO^{\nats}}{\setop}$-substitution programs
$(\Theta_n)_{n \in \nats}$ in two parts. We show in Lemma~\ref{} that for each
$n \in \nats$ we can expand each formula in $\Theta_n$ into an equivalent
sequence of $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas. We then show in Lemma~\ref{} that by
expanding each formula in $\Theta_n$ and then concatenating the resultant
sequence we can define a $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO(\setquant)$-substitution
programs that defines the same query as $(\Theta_n)_{n \in \nats}$.

We first define what it means to expand a formula in a substitution program into
an equivalent sequence of formulas. Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary and let $\setop$
be a set of operators. Let $\setquant$ be the corresponding set of extended
quantifiers. Let $\theta (\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}; \vec{V})$ be a formula in
$\exlogic{\FO^{\nats}}{\setop}[\rho]$ defined in terms of a sequence of
mixed-sort second-order variables $\vec{V} = (V_1, \ldots, V_v)$. For each $i
\in [v]$ let $v_i$ and $m_i$ be the arity of the element sort and number sort of
$V_i$.

Let $n \in \nats$. Let $\boldsymbol{\theta}_n = \{\theta_{n; \beta}(\vec{x};
\vec{W}^n) : \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\mu}} \}$ in $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$, where
$\vec{W}^n = \{ V^n_{i, \vec{a}} : i \in [v], \vec{a} \in [n]^{m_i}\}$, and for
each $i \in [v]$, $\vec{a} \in [n]^{m_i}$ we have that $V^n_{i, \vec{a}}$ is an
element-sort second-order variable with arity $v_i$. We say
$\boldsymbol{\theta}_n$ \emph{translates $\theta$ for $n$} if for all
\begin{myenum}
\item $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho, n]$,
\item assignments $\alpha \in A^{\vec{x}}$ and $\beta \in [n]^{\vec{\mu}}$, and
\item assignments $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ to the second-order variables, where
  $\gamma$ maps $V_i$ to a relation $V^{\gamma}_i \subseteq A^{v_i} \times
  [n]^{m_i}$ and $\gamma'$ maps $V^n_{i, \vec{c}}$ to the relation $V^{n,
    \gamma'}_{i, \vec{c}} \subseteq A^{v_i}$ such that $(\vec{a}, \vec{c}) \in
  V^{\gamma}_{i}$ if, and only if, $\vec{a} \in V^{n, \gamma'}_{i, \vec{c}}$
  then
\end{myenum}
\vspace{-2.8mm}
\begin{align*}
  \mathcal{A} \models \theta [\alpha , \beta, \gamma]  \iff \mathcal{A} \models \theta_{n;\beta} [\alpha, \gamma'].
\end{align*}

We say $\boldsymbol{\theta} = (\boldsymbol{\theta}_n)_{n \in \nats}$ translates
$\theta$ if $\boldsymbol{\theta}_n$ translates $\theta$ for all $n \in \nats$.
We similarly define a \emph{translation} for number-terms. Let $\eta(\vec{x},
\vec{\mu}; \vec{V})$ be a number term and let $n \in \nats$. We say that
$\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\eta}_n = \{\theta^{\eta}_{n, k; \beta}(\vec{x},
\vec{V}^n_1, \ldots, \vec{V}^n_{v}) : k \in \nats, \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\mu}} \}$
\emph{translates} $\eta$ for $n$ if for all $k \in \nats$ and all $\mathcal{A}$,
$\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\gamma'$ defined as above we have
\begin{align*}
  \eta^{(\mathcal{A}; \alpha, \beta, \gamma)} = k \iff \mathcal{A} \models \theta^{\eta}_{n, k; \beta}[\alpha, \gamma'].
\end{align*}

We are now ready to prove that a formula that appears in a
$\exlogic{\FO^\nats}{\setop}$-substitution program may be translated to a
sequence of $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas, where $\setquant$ is the set of extended
quantifiers associated with $\setop$. Moreover, we show that this translation
can be constructed by an algorithm that runs within a prescribed time.

\begin{lem}
  \label{lem:translate-program-line}
  Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let $\setop$ be a set of normal operators and let
  $\setquant$ be the corresponding set of extended quantifiers. Suppose
  $\exlogic{\FO^{\nats}}{\setop}$ has constant numeric-width. Let
  $\theta(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}; \vec{V}) \in \exlogic{\FO^{\nats}}{\setop}[\rho]$
  be a formula defined in terms of the mixed-sort second-order variables
  $\vec{V} = (V_1, \ldots, V_v)$. Let $t$ be the numeric-width and $w$ be the
  number-variable width of $\theta$.
  
  There exists a set of formulas $\boldsymbol{\theta} = \{\theta_{n;
    \beta}(\vec{x}; \vec{W}^n) : n \in \nats, \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\mu}} \}$ in
  $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$ that translates $\theta$. We also have that each
  formula in $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ has variable-width less than the
  element-variable width of $\theta$. Moreover, the function that maps $(n,
  \theta)$ to $(\theta_{n, \beta})_{\beta \in [n]^{\vec{\mu}}}$ is computable in
  time $c^{\vert \cl{\theta} \vert} \cdot n^{c \cdot \vert \cl{\theta} \vert
    \cdot (t + w)}$ for some constant $c$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $n \in \nats$. We aim to recursively define a translation for $n$ for each
  formula and number-term in $\theta$. That is, for a sub-formula or
  sub-number-term $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu} ; \vec{V})$ of $\theta$ we define a
  translation of $\gamma$ for $n$ given translations of the sub-formulas and
  sub-number-terms of $\gamma$ for $n$. More precisely, if $\gamma$ is a
  number-term we will define a sequence of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$-formulas
  $\boldsymbol{\phi}^{\gamma}_n = \{\phi^{\gamma}_{n, k; \beta}(\vec{y};
  \vec{W}^n) : \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}}, k \leq n^t \}$ that translates
  $\gamma$ for $n$ and if $\gamma$ is a formula we will define a sequence
  $\boldsymbol{\phi}^{\gamma}_n = \{\phi^{\gamma}_{n ; \beta}(\vec{y};
  \vec{W}^n): \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}} \}$ that translates $\gamma$ for $n$. In
  these formulas $\vec{W}^n = \{ V^n_{i, \vec{a}} : i \in [v], \vec{a} \in
  [n]^{m_i}\}$. We prove this result by considering cases. In each case we let
  $\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \ldots$ denote the sub-formulas or sub-number-terms of
  $\gamma$ and we let $\beta$ denote an arbitrary assignments to the free number
  variables in $\gamma$.

  We first consider the base cases. Suppose $\gamma$ is a number-variable or a
  constant (i.e.\ $0$ or $1$). If $\gamma$ evaluates to $k$ under the assignment
  $\beta$ let $\phi^{\gamma}_{n, k; \beta}$ be a tautology and otherwise let
  $\phi^{\gamma}_{n, k; \beta}$ be a contradiction. Suppose $\gamma$ is an
  atomic formula or (non-number) term. If the free variables in $\psi$ are all
  element variables then let $\phi^{\gamma}_{n; \beta} = \gamma$. If
  $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V}) = V_i(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ for some $i
  \in [v]$ let $\phi^{\gamma}_{n; \beta}(\vec{y}) = V^n_{i, \beta(\vec{\nu})}$.
  This suffices to give a translation of $\gamma$ for $n$ in this case.

  We now consider the multiplication case. The other arithmetic functions may be
  handled similarly. Suppose $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V})$ is a number
  term and suppose $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V}) = \gamma_1(\vec{y}_1,
  \vec{\nu}_1; \vec{V}) \cdot \gamma_2(\vec{y}_2, \vec{\nu}_2; \vec{V})$. Let
  $\beta_1 \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}_1}$ and $\beta_2 \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}_2}$ be
  compatible with $\beta$, then for each $k \leq n^{t}$ let
  \begin{align*}
    \phi^{\gamma}_{n, k ; \beta} =
    \uset{a, b \leq k}{ a \cdot b = k}{\bigvee}(\phi^{\gamma_1}_{n, a;
    \beta_1} \land \phi^{\gamma_2}_{n, b; \beta_2}).
  \end{align*}

  We now handle the less-than relation for number-terms. The equality relation
  may be handled similarly. Suppose $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V}) =
  \gamma_1(\vec{y}_1, \vec{\nu}_1; \vec{V}) \leq \gamma_2 (\vec{y}_2,
  \vec{\nu}_2 ; \vec{V})$. Let $\beta_1 \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}_1}$ and $\beta_2 \in
  [n]^{\vec{\nu}_2}$ be compatible with $\beta$, and let
  \begin{align*}
    \phi^{\gamma}_{n; \beta} = \uset{a, b \leq n^t}{a \leq
    b}{\bigwedge} (\phi^{\gamma_1}_{n, a; \beta_1} \land \phi^{\gamma_2}_{n, b;
    \beta_2}).
  \end{align*}
  
  We now handle conjunction between formulas. The other logical connectives may
  be handled similarly. Suppose $\gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V}) =
  \gamma_1(\vec{y}_1, \vec{\nu} ; \vec{V}) \land \gamma_2 (\vec{y}_2,
  \vec{\nu}_2 ; \vec{V})$. Let $\beta_1 \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}_1}$ and $\beta_2 \in
  [n]^{\vec{\nu}_2}$ be compatible with $\beta$. Let $\phi^{\gamma}_{n ; \beta}
  = \phi^{\gamma_1}_{n ; \beta_1} \land \phi^{\gamma_2}_{n ; \beta_2}$.

  We now handle the operator case. Let $\Omega_{E, \ar} \in \setop$ and suppose
  \begin{align*}
    \gamma(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}; \vec{V}) = \Omega_{E, \ar} [\vec{\pi}] [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\chi_i))_{i \in [r]}].
  \end{align*}
  For each $i \in [r]$, $l \in [r_i]$ let $s^i_l = \zeta(R_i)(l)$ and $c^i_l =
  \ar(s^i_l, 2)$. Let $T^i_n := [n]^{c^i_l} \times , \ldots, \times
  [n]^{c^i_{r_i}}$. Let $\Upsilon_i : T^n_i \ra \FO(\setquant)[\rho]$ be defined
  by $\Upsilon_i (\vec{m}_1, \ldots, \vec{m}_{r_i}) = \phi^{\chi_i}_{n ;
    \beta_i}$, where $\beta_i$ is an assignments to all the free number
  variables in $\chi_i$ such that (i) $\beta_i$ agrees with $\beta$ for each
  variable in $\vec{\nu}$ not bound by the operator and (ii) $\beta_i$ assigns
  $\vec{\mu}^i_{j}$ to $\vec{m}_j$ for each $j \in [r_i]$. For each $i \in
  [\vert \pi \vert]$ let $\alpha_i$ be an assignment to the free number
  variables in $\vec{\pi}(i)$ compatible with $\beta$. Let
  \begin{align*}
    \phi^{\gamma}_{n; \beta} := \bigvee_{p_1, \ldots, p_{\vert \vec{\pi} \vert} \leq n^t}[(\bigwedge_{i \in [\vert \vec{\pi}\vert]} \phi^{\pi(i)}_{n, p_i; \alpha_i}) \land Q^{E, \ar}_{n, (p_1, \ldots, p_{\vert \vec{\pi} \vert})} ((\vec{x}^{j}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^{j}_{r_j}) \cdot \Upsilon_j)_{j \in [r]}].
  \end{align*}
  
  We can think of the $\forall$ and $\exists$ quantifiers as generalised
  operators, and so these case are subsumed by the operator case. There is an
  obvious recursive algorithm implementing the construction above. It can be
  shown by reviewing each of the above cases that the cost of computing the
  translation for a sub-formula or sub-number-term $\gamma (\vec{y}, \vec{\nu} ;
  \vec{V})$ is at most $(c_1 \cdot n^{c_2 \cdot (t_{\gamma} + w_{\gamma} )}
  \cdot X)$, where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants, $t_{\gamma}$ and $w_{\gamma}$
  are the numeric-width of $\gamma$ and number-variable width, respectively, and
  $X$ is the maximal cost of translating a sub-formula or sub-number-term of
  $\gamma$. It follow that for a given $n$ and $\theta$ we can construct a
  family of formulas $\boldsymbol{\theta}_n$ that translates $\theta$ for $n$ in
  at most $c^{\vert \cl{\theta} \vert}_1 \cdot n^{c_2 \vert \cl{\theta} \vert
    \cdot (t + w)}$. The result follows.

%   substitution programs with constant program-width and relation-width then it
%   can be defined by a $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO (\setquant)$ substitution
%   programs.
% \end{lem}
% \begin{proof}
%   Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. Let $I = (I_n : [M_n] \ra \FO^{\nats} \ra
%   \FO^{\nats}(\setop)[\tau])_{n \in \nats}$ be a $\PT$-uniform family of
%   substitution programs. Let $n \in \nats$. For each $w \in [M_n]$ let
%   $\theta_w (\vec{x}) := I_n(w)$. For each mixed-sort second-order variable
%   $V_i$ with arity $(v_i, m_i)$ we define a family of element-sort
%   second-order variables $\mathbb{V}_i = \{V_{i, \vec{a}} : \vec{a} \in
%   [n]^{m_i}\}$ such that $v_{i, \vec{a}}$ is the arity of $V_{i, \vec{a}}$.

%   Fix $w \in [M_n]$ and let $\theta_{n,w} (\vec{x}, \vec{\mu}) := I_n(w)$. We
%   aim to define for each number term $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ appearing in
%   $\theta_w(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu})$ a sequence of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$-formulas
%   $\{\phi^{\eta}_{n, w; k; \beta}(\vec{y}))_{\beta \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}}}) :
%   \beta \in [n]^{\vec{\nu}}, k \in \nats\}$.
  
%   We say that a number term $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ in
%   $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)$ has a \emph{translation for $n$} if there is a
%   sequence of $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas $(\phi^{\eta}_{n, k;

%   $\rho$-structure $\mathcal{A}$ of size $n$ and for each assignment $\alpha

%   \beta}[\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{a} \models (\eta = k)[\alpha \cup
%   \beta]$.

%   We say a formula $\psi(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ in $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)$ has a
%   \emph{translation for $n$} if there is a sequence of
%   $\FO(\setquant)$-formulas $(\phi_{n; \beta} (\vec{y}))_{\beta \in

%   and each assignment $\alpha \in [n]^{\vec{y}}$, we have that $\mathcal{A}
%   \models \phi_{n; \vec{\beta}}[\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models
%   \phi[\alpha \cup \beta]$.

%   We aim to show that $\theta(\vec{x}, \vec{\mu})$ has a \emph{translation for
%   $n$} by induction on the structure of the formula. It is easy to see that if
%   $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ is a number variable or a constant (i.e. $0$ or
%   $1$) then $\eta$ has a translation for $n$. We also have that if
%   $\psi(\vec{y})$ is a formula then $\psi(\vec{y})$ is its own translation for
%   $n$. If $psi(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = V_i(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ then the
%   assignment $\psi_{n; \beta}(\vec{y}) = V_{i, \beta(\vec{\nu})}$ defines a
%   translation for $n$.

%   Let $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu})$ be a number term and suppose all sub-formulas
%   and sub-number-terms of $\eta$ have a translation for $n$. Let $\beta \in
%   [n]^{\vec{\nu}}$. Suppose $\eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = \eta_1(\vec{y}_1,
%   \vec{\nu}_1) \cdot \eta_2(\vec{y}_2, \vec{\nu}_2)$. Let $\beta_1 \in
%   [n]^{\vec{nu}_1}$ and $\beta_2 \in [n]^{\vec{nu}_2}$ be assignments
%   compatible with $\beta$. Let $\psi^{\eta}_{n, k ; \beta} (\vec{y}) =
%   \underset{a, b \leq k, a \cdot b = k}{\bigvee}(\psi^{\eta)_1}_{n, a;
%   \beta}(\vec{x}) \land \psi^{\eta_2}_{n, b; \beta}(\vec{x}))$. The other
%   arithmetic cases are handled similarly.

%   We now consider the application of an operator. Let $\Omega \in \setop$ and
%   suppose

%   \begin{align*}
%   \eta(\vec{y}, \vec{\nu}) = \Omega_{E} [\vec{\pi}] [((\vec{x}^i_1 \vec{\mu}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i} \vec{\mu}^i_{r_i})(\chi_i))_{i \in [l]}].
% \end{align*}
% For each $i \in [l]$ let $T_i = [n]^{c_1} \times , \ldots, \times
% [n]^{c_{r_i}}$. Let $T$ be a function that maps $i \in [l]$ to $T_i$. where
% $c_{j}$ is the arity of ...x
% \begin{align*}
%   \psi^{\eta}_{n, k; \beta}(\vec{x}) := \bigvee_{p_1, \ldots, p_{\vert \vec{\pi} \vert}, e \leq M}[&(\bigwedge_{i \leq \vert \vec{\pi}\vert} \psi^{\pi_{i}}_{n, p_i; \beta}(\vec{x})) \\ &\land Q_{E, T ; (p_1, \ldots, p_n); e} ((\vec{x}^{j, \vec{t}}_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^{j, \vec{t}}_{r_i}) \cdot (\chi_{i, \vec{t}})_{ n; \beta})_{j \in [l], \vec{t} \in T_j}]

Let $L$ be a logic with constant numeric-width. Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary. We
say that a $\PT$-uniform family of $L[\rho]$-substitution programs $(\Phi_n)_{n
  \in \nats}$ is \emph{bounded} if there is a constant $k \in \nats$ such that
for each $n \in \nats$ the numeric-width and length of each formula in $\Phi_n$
is less than $k$.

\begin{lem}
  Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary and let $\setop$ be a set of normal operators such
  that $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)$ has constant numeric-width. Let $\setquant$ be the
  corresponding set of quantifiers. If a query can be defined by a bounded
  $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO^{\nats} (\setop)[\rho]$-substitution programs
  then it can be defined by a $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO
  (\setquant)[\rho]$-substitution programs with constant width.
  \label{lem:translate-sub-operators-to-queries}
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
  Let $\Theta := (\Theta_{n})_{n \in \nats}$ be a bounded $\PT$-uniform family
  of $\FO^{\nats}(\setop)[\rho]$-substitution programs. For each $n \in \nats$
  let $M_n := \dom(\Theta_n)$. For each $n \in \nats$, $i \in M_n$ let
  $\vec{x}^n_i$ and $\vec{\mu}^n_i$ be the free element variables and number
  variables in $\Theta_n(i)$. Let $V^n_i$ be a mixed-sort second-order variable
  with type $(\vec{x}^n_i, \vec{\mu}^n_i)$. We think of $V^n_i$ as the
  second-order variable associated with the formula $\Theta_n(i)$. For each $n
  \in \nats$, $i \in M_n$, and $\vec{a} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_i \vert}$ let
  $V^n_{i ; \vec{a}}$ be an element-sort second-order variable with arity $\vert
  \vec{x}^n_i\vert$. Let $\theta_{n, i}(\vec{x}^n_i, \vec{\mu}^n_i; \vec{V}^n_i)
  := \Theta_n(i)$, where $\vec{V}^n_i = (V^n_j)_{j > i}$. Let
  $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n, i} := \{\theta_{n, i; \beta} (\vec{x}^n_i
  ,\vec{\mu}^n_i ; \vec{W}^n_{i}) : \vec{a} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_i
    \vert}\}$ be a translation of $\theta_{n, i}$ for $n$, where $\vec{W}^n_i =
  \{V^{n}_{j; \vec{a}} : j \in M_n, j > i, \vec{a} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_j
    \vert}\}$. Importantly, it follows from
  Lemma~\ref{lem:translate-program-line} and the fact that $\Theta$ is bounded
  that there is a an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in $n$ that takes a
  formula $\theta_{n, i}$ and outputs the translation $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n,
    i}$ for $n$.

  Let $M_n' = \{(i, \vec{a}) : i \in M_n, \vec{a} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_i
    \vert}\}$. Let $\Theta_n' : M_n' \ra \FO(\setquant)[\rho]$ be defined by
  $\Theta_n' (i, \vec{a}) := \theta_{n, i; \beta}$, where $\beta$ maps
  $\vec{\mu}^n_i$ to $\vec{a}$, for each $(i, \vec{a}) \in M_n'$. Let $\Theta' =
  (\Theta_n')_{n \in \nats}$. Since $M_n'$ is a product of two linearly ordered
  sets, we can define a lexographical order on $M_n'$. Let $i, j \in M_n$ and
  suppose $i > j$. Then, from the definition of a substitution program,
  $\theta_{n, i}$ does not contain the second-order variable $V^n_{j}$. It
  follows from the definition of a translation that for all $\vec{a} \in
  [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_i \vert}$ and $\vec{b} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_j
    \vert}$ the translation $\theta_{n, i ; \beta}$, where $\beta$ is the
  assignment that maps $\vec{\mu}^n_i$ to $\vec{a}$, does not contain any
  second-order variable $V^n_{j ; \vec{b}}$. Moreover, for a fixed $n \in \nats$
  and $i \in M_n$ all of the formulas in $\boldsymbol{\theta}_{n, i}$ are
  defined in terms of the same set of second-order variables. It follows that
  for all $(i, \vec{a}), (j, \vec{b}) \in M_n'$, $(i, \vec{a}) < (j, \vec{b})$
  $\Theta_n'(i, \vec{a})$ does not contain the second-order variable $V^n_{j;
    \vec{b}}$. In other words, $\Theta_n'$ is a well-formed substitution
  program.

  \begin{claim}
    For each $n \in \nats$ let $\theta_n(\vec{x}^n_1, \vec{\mu}^n_1)$ be the
    flattening of $\Theta_n$ and for each $\vec{c} \in [n]^{\vert
      \vec{\mu}^n_1\vert}$ let $\theta_{n, \vec{c}}'(\vec{x}^n_1)$ be the
    flattening of $\Theta_n'$ at $(1, \vec{c})$. Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho,
    n]$. Let $\alpha \in A^{\vec{x}^n_1}$ and let $\beta \in
    [n]^{\vec{\mu}^n_1}$. Then $\mathcal{A} \models \theta_n [\alpha, \beta]$
    if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models \theta_{n,
      \beta(\vec{\mu}^n_1)}[\alpha]$.
  \end{claim}
  \begin{proof}
    Let $n \in \nats$. For each $i \in M_n$ and $\vec{c} \in [n]^{\vert
      \vec{\mu}^n_i\vert}$ let $\phi_{n, i}$ be the flattening of $\Theta_n$ at
    $i$ and let $\phi_{n, (i, \vec{c})}'$ be the flattening of $\Theta_n'$ at
    $(i, \vec{a})$. Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho, n]$. We will prove by
    backwards induction that for each $i \in M_n$, $\vec{c} \in [n]^{\vert
      \vec{\mu}^n_i\vert}$, and assignments $\alpha \in A^{\vec{x}^n_i}$ and
    $\beta$ that maps $\vec{\mu}^n_i$ to $\vec{c}$, we have that $\mathcal{A}
    \models \phi_{n, i}[\alpha, \beta]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models
    \phi_{n, (i, \vec{c})}[\alpha]$.

    % Let $n \in \nats$, $(i, \vec{a}) \in M_n'$ let $M_{n, (i, \vec{a})}' =
    % \{(j,
    % \vec{b}) : (i, \vec{a}) \leq (j, \vec{b})\}$ and let $M_{n, i} = \{j : i
    % \leq j\}$. Let $\Psi_{n, (i, \vec{a})}'$ be the restriction of $\Theta_n'$
    % to $M_{n, (i, \vec{a})}$ and let $\Psi_{n, i}$ be the restriction of
    % $\Theta_n$ to $M_{n, i}$. We now prove that for each $(i, \vec{a}) \in
    % M_n'$
    % the flattening of $\Psi_{n, \vec(i, \vec{a})}'$ defines the same query as
    % the flattening of $\Psi_{n, i}$ with the assignment that $\vec{\mu}^n_i$
    % to
    % $\vec{a}$. The proof is by backwards induction. Let $i \in M_n$ and let
    % $\vec{a} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_i \vert}$. Let $\phi_{n, i}$ be the
    % flattening of $\Phi_{n, i}$ and let $\phi_{n, (i, \vec{a})}$ be the
    % flattening of $\Phi_{n, (i, \vec{a})}$. Let $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho,
    % n]$
    % and suppose we have assignments $\alpha \in A^{\vec{x}^n_i}$ and $\beta$
    % that maps $\vec{\mu}^n_i$ to $\vec{a}$.

    We begin with the base case. Suppose $i$ is the maximum value in $M_n$. Then
    no second-order variables appear in $\Theta_n(i)$ and hence, from the
    definition of a translation for $n$, no second-order variables in
    $\Theta_n'(i, \vec{c})$. It follows that $\phi_{n, i} = \Theta_n(i)$ and
    $\phi_{n, (i, \vec{c})}' = \Theta_{n}(i, \vec{c})$. Moreover, from the
    definition of a translation for $n$, we have that $\mathcal{A} \models
    \Theta_{n}(i)[\alpha, \beta]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A} \models
    \Theta_{n}'(i, \vec{c}) [\alpha, \beta]$. The base case follows.

    Suppose $i$ is not the maximal value in $M_n$ and the inductive proposition
    holds for all $j > i$. Let $\gamma$ an assignment that maps each mixed-sort
    second-order variable $V^n_j$ to the relation defined by $(\phi_{n,
      j})^{\mathcal{A}}$ for each $j > i$. Let $\gamma'$ be the assignment that
    maps each element-sort second-order variable $V^n_{j, \vec{c}}$ to the
    relation defined by $(\phi_{n, (j, \vec{c})})^{\mathcal{A}}$ for each $j >
    i$ and $\vec{c} \in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_j \vert}$.

    Let $j > i$, $\vec{c}\in [n]^{\vert \vec{\mu}^n_j \vert}$, $\alpha \in
    A^{\vec{\mu}^n_j}$ and $\beta = \beta^{\vec{\mu}^n_j}_{\vec{c}}$. We notice
    the following. From the induction hypothesis we have that $\mathcal{A}
    \models \phi_{n, (j, \vec{c})}' [\alpha]$ if, and only if, $\mathcal{A}
    \models \phi_{n, j}[\alpha, \beta]$, where $\beta$ maps $\vec{\mu}^n_j$ to
    $\vec{c}$. It follows from the definition of $\gamma$ and $\gamma'$ that
    $(\vec{a}, \vec{c}) \in V^n_{j}$ if, and only if, $\vec{a} \in V^n_{j,
      \vec{c}}$. We have
    \begin{align*}
      \mathcal{A} \models \phi_{n, i} [\alpha, \beta] \iff \mathcal{A} \models \theta_{n, i}[\alpha, \beta, \gamma] \iff \mathcal{A} \models \theta_{n, i ; \beta}[\alpha, \gamma'] \iff \mathcal{A} \models \phi_{n, (i, \vec{c})}[\alpha],
    \end{align*}
    where the first and third equivalences follow from the definition of a
    flattening and the second equivalence follows from the definition of a
    translation for $n$. The result follows by induction.
  \end{proof}

  We have for each $n \in \nats$ that $\Theta_n(1)$ has no free number
  variables. Let $\theta_n$ and $\theta_n'$ be the flattening of $\Theta_n$ and
  $\Theta_n'$. It follows that no free number variables appear in $\theta_n$ and
  $\theta_n'$. Then, from the claim, we have that $\mathcal{A} \models
  \theta_n[\alpha]$ if, and only if $\mathcal{A} \models \theta_n'[\alpha]$ for
  each $\mathcal{A} \in \fin[\rho, n]$ and assignment $\alpha \in
  A^{\vec{x}^n_1}$. It follows that $\Theta'$ defines the same query as
  $\Theta$.

  Since $\Theta$ is $\PT$-uniform the function that maps $n$ to $\Theta_n$ is
  computable in time polynomial in $n$. Moreover, the function that maps any
  $\Theta_n(i)$ (for $n \in \nats$, $i \in M_n$) to the translation of
  $\Theta_n(i)$ for $n$ is computable in time polynomial in $n$. It follows that
  the function $n \mapsto \Theta_n'$ is computable in time polynomial in $n$. We
  also have from Lemma~\ref{lem:translate-program-line} that there is a constant
  bound on the width of $\Theta'$. In summary, we have that $\Theta'$ is a
  $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$-substitution programs with
  constant width and $\Theta'$ defines the same query as $\Theta$. The result
  follows.
\end{proof}

\section{Infinitary Logics}
Let $\setquant$ be a set of extended quantifiers. We define the extension of
$\mathcal{L}$ by $\setquant$ by extending the formula formation rules for
$\mathcal{L}$ with the following rule:

\begin{textbox}[14.0cm]
  Let $Q^{E, \ar}_{\vec{a}, n} \in \setquant$, $i \in [r]$, $l \in [r_i]$ let
  $c^i_l = \ar(\zeta(R_i)(l), 2)$ and let $T^i_n := [n]^{c^i_l} \times , \ldots,
  \times [n]^{c^i_{r_i}}$. Let $T_n$ be the function that maps $i \in [r]$ to
  $T^i_n$. Let $\Upsilon_i : T^i_n \ra L(Q^{E, \ar}_{\vec{p}, n})$. For each $i
  \in [r]$ and $l \in [r_i]$ let $s = \zeta (R_i)(l)$ and let $\vec{x}^i_l$ be
  an $\ar(s, 1)$-length tuple of element variables. Then $Q^{E, \ar}_{\vec{p},
    n} [(\vec{x}^i_1, \ldots, \vec{x}^i_{r_i}) \cdot \Upsilon_i]_{i \in [r]}$ is
  a formula in $\mathcal{L}(\setquant)$.
\end{textbox}

\begin{prop}
  Let $\rho$ be a vocabulary and $\setop$ be a set of operators. Let $\setquant$
  be the corresponding set of extended quantifiers. Then each query definable in
  $\FP^{\nats}(\setop)[\rho]$ can be defined by a bounded $\PT$-uniform family
  of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$ substitution programs and each query definable by a
  $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$ is definable by a formula of
  $\mathcal{C}^{\omega}(\setquant)[\rho]$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
  The first part of the result follows from Lemma~\ref{}. Let $(\Phi_n)_{n \in
    \nats}$ be a $\PT$-uniform family of $\FO(\setquant)[\rho]$-substitution
  programs with constant width. Let $(\phi_n)_{n \in \nats}$ be such that
  $\phi_n$ is the flattening of $\Phi_n$ for all $n \in \nats$. We can rename
  variables such that there exists a sequence of element variables $\vec{x}$
  such that for each $n \in \nats$ the free element variables in $\phi_n$ are
  amoung those in $\vec{x}$. Let $\theta (\vec{x}) = \bigwedge_{n \in \nats}
  (\exists^{=n} \, x = x) \land \phi_n (\vec{x})$. It follows from the fact that
  $\Phi$ has constant width that $\theta \in \mathcal{L}^\omega(\setquant)$.
  Moreover, $\theta$ and $(\Phi_n)_{n \in \nats}$ define the same query. The
  second part of the result follows.
  % **problem, we need some sort of width condition
  % **problem, we need counting
  % **problem, each $\phi_n$ must have the same set of free variables
\end{proof}

\section{Important Examples and Interesting Classes}
We have developed a theory of generalised operators and shown that each family
of generalised operators can be associated with a family of extended
quantifiers. We have also showed that each formula in an extension of $\FP$ by a
family of operators is equivalent to a formula is the extension of $\mathcal{L}$
by the associated family of extended quantifiers. We consider a few important
logics as examples. These logics will also act as 

with a family and shown that fixed-point logics extended by generalised
operators can be thought of as formulas in an some in


\begin{definition}
  Let $\setop$ be a set of operators. Let $L$ be an extension of $\FO^{\nats}$.
  Let $T_1$ and $T_2$ be function that map operators to operators such for each
  $\Omega \in \setop$ if $E$ and $\ar$ are the evaluation and arity functions of
  $\Omega$ and for $\ar_1, \ar_2 : \dom(\ar) \ra \nats$ are defined such that
  for each $(s, i) \in \dom (\ar)$, $\ar_1 (s, i) = \ar (s, i)$ and $\ar_2 (s,
  i) = 0$ if $i = 1$, otherwise $\ar_1 (s, i) = 0$ and $\ar_2 (s, i) = \ar(s,
  i)$ and for each $i \in [2]$, $T_i (\Omega) = \Omega_{E, \ar_i}$. We call
  $\restr{\setop}{1} = T_1 (\setop)$ the \emph{projection of $\setop$ to
    element-sort} and $\restr{\setop}{2} = T_2 (\setop)$ the \emph{projection of
    $\setop$ to number-sort}. We say that $\setop$ is \emph{element grounded in
    $L(\setop)$} if $L(\setop) \equiv L(\restr{\setop}{1})$. We say that
  $\setop$ is \emph{number grounded in $L(\setop)$} if $L(\setop) \equiv
  L(\restr{\setop}{2})$.

  Let $T^{\text{Sep}}$ be a function on $\setop$ defined such that for each
  $\Omega \in \setop$ if $E$ and $\ar$ are the evaluation and arity functions of
  $\Omega$ then $T^{\text{Sep}}$ is the set of all $\Omega_{E, \ar'}$ where
  $\ar' : \dom (\ar) \ra \nats$ is defined such that for each symbol $s$ in the
  vocabulary of $\Omega$, $\sum_{i \in [2]} \ar' (s, i) \leq 1$. Let
  $\setop^{\text{Sep}} = \bigcup_{\Omega \in \setop} T^{\text{Sep}}(\Omega)$. We
  say that $\setop$ is \emph{separable in $L(\setop)$} if $L(\setop) \equiv
  L(\setop^{\text{Sep}})$.


\end{definition}

\section{Operators and Descriptive Complexity}
Dawar~\cite{} has shown that if there is a logic that captures $\PT$ then there
is an extension of $\FO$ with uniform families of quantifiers that captures
$\PT$. We now re-frame this result within the generalised operator framework. We
also show that any logic that captures $\PT$ must be closed under operator
quotients.

\begin{lem}
  Let $\Omega$ be a set of generalised operators. If $\exlogic{\FO}{\Omega} \leq
  \PT$ then $\FO(\Omega) \leq \PT$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
  If there is a logic that captures $\PT$ then there is a set of generalised
  operators $\setop$ such that $\FOC(\setop)$ captures $\PT$ and $\FOC(\setop)$
  is closed under operator quotients.
  \label{prop:P-uniform-quantifiers}
